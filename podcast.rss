				<itunes:subtitle>In this episode, we talk about the unsolved mystery of Dyatlov Pass.</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>To the east of the Ural mountains, in Yekaterinburg city cemetery, there is a group grave of 9 members from a hiking group who died mysteriously.</p>

<h4 id="timeline">Timeline</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Arrived by train at Ivdel a town at the centre of the northern province of Sverdlovsk Oblast on 25<sup>th</sup> January 1959.</li>
  <li>Took a truck ride to Vizhai (last settlement towards the north).</li>
  <li>Hikers purchased and had loaves of bread when they were in Vizhai to keep energy high.</li>
  <li>Started trek towards Otorten from Vizhai on 27<sup>th</sup> January.</li>
  <li>Yuri Yudin returned on 28<sup>th</sup> due to health issues.</li>
  <li>On 31<sup>st</sup>, the hikers arrived at a highland area and started preparing for their climb. They saved surplus food in a wooded area for their return hike.</li>
  <li>Snowstorms resulted in hikers being deviated from their intended path and ended up on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl (Dead Mountain).</li>
  <li>Group decided to camp on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl instead of hiking all the way back into the wooded area about 1.5 km away. It is speculated that the group wanted to practice camping on a mountain slope.</li>
  <li>Dyatlov had told his sports club that he would send a telegram from Vizhai no later than 12<sup>th</sup> February and that it might take even longer.</li>
  <li>It was not until 20<sup>th</sup> that the relatives of the hikers demanded a search be conducted for the missing hikers.</li>
  <li>The search party was mobilised and the military also took part in the search. On 26<sup>th</sup> of February, the search party found the tent that was used by the hikers.</li>
  <li>The tent was torn from inside and the hikers were missing. All the belongings including warm clothing and shoes were left behind.</li>
  <li>A set of footprints could be found heading away from the tent towards the woods, but after 500m, the tracks disappeared in the snow.</li>
  <li>At the edge of the forest, under a Siberian Pine tree, there was a visible sign of a fire that was lit.</li>
  <li>The first two bodies, Krivonischenko and Doroshenko were found shoeless near the fire site wearing only their underwears.</li>
  <li>The tree also had visible marks of someone having climbed it, with branches up to 5 metres broken. Someone seems to have climbed the tree to either escape from something or to look at something in distance.</li>
  <li>Further search in the snow between the camp and the pine tree revealed the bodies of Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin. Their poses suggested that they were trying to return to the campsite perhaps for food and warm clothing. They were found at a distance of 300, 480 and 630 metres from the tree respectively.</li>
  <li>The four remaining hikers were not found until 4<sup>th</sup> of May under 4 metres of snow around 75 metres away from the pine tree towards the woods. These four happened to be better dressed than others and the ones who died later were wearing the clothes of the ones who had died earlier. A hastily constructed den was found near the bodies.</li>
  <li>Something happened on the night of 31<sup>st</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> which lead to the death of all the hikers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="inquiry">Inquiry</h4>
<ul>
  <li>An inquiry was started into the matter after the first five bodies were found. It was concluded that hypothermia was the reason for the deaths.</li>
  <li>The finding of the four bodies later presented puzzling details which changed the course of the inquest.</li>
  <li>Three of the four hikers had serious fatal injuries to the head and chest area.</li>
  <li>Doctors concluded that the force required to cause a similar injury would be something similar to that of a car hitting a person.</li>
  <li>Except for Dubinina who was missing her tongue, eyes, parts of lips and a part of the skull, no major external wounds were found on the bodies. It was later claimed that these injuries were a result of her being face down on the water.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="theories">Theories</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The inquest concluded that all the hikers had died of a compelling natural force. The inquiry was stopped in May and all the files sent to secret archives.</li>
  <li><strong>Mansi</strong>: Mansi do not frequently visit this area and the mountain and they were not territorial.</li>
  <li><strong>Robbery</strong>: No valuables were taken from the tent or the hikers</li>
  <li><strong>Animal attack</strong>: No attack marks or animal footprints. This area wasn’t a hunting ground for animals.</li>
  <li><strong>Avalanche</strong>: Most possible explaination but since the</li>
  <li><strong>Soviet Military Projects</strong>: Bomb testing would’ve startled he hikers or caused avalanche. Radioactivity was detected in one of the hikers. Conspiracy theorists state that some of the hikers might have come across a secret military project and would’ve been killed by the military or died when they were pursuide. Interestingly, the bodies were searched for radioactivity which under normal circumstances is not a normal test. This raises further suspicions.</li>
  <li><strong>Govt. Coverup</strong>: Govt wanted the investigation to wrap up quickly. For three years after the incident, the area was closed for genral public.</li>
  <li><strong>Infrasound Theory</strong>: Infrasound causing panic attack.</li>
  <li><strong>Katabatic Winds</strong>: Strong winds blowing down the slope were also claimed to have taken the lives of the hikers.</li>
  <li><strong>Out of control partying</strong>: Excessive partying with alcohol or drugs, causing disorientation amongst the hikers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some hikers about 50km south of Dyatlov Pass who were hiking at the same time claim to have seen fireballs in the sky.</p>

				<itunes:subtitle>In this episode, we talk about the life saving ejection seat.</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-is-ejection-seat">What is ejection seat?</h3>
<p>The ejection seat is a safety mechanism primarily used in aircraft to save a pilot or a passenger by propelling the seat out of the disabled aircraft.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An explosive charge or rocket is used to propel the seat to a safe distance and a parachute takes care of the rest of the journey down to the ground.</li>
  <li><strong>Everald Calthorp</strong> who earlier had invented parachutes devised an ejection seat that used compressed air.</li>
  <li>Romanian inventor <strong>Ananstase Dragomir</strong> proposed the modern layout for ejection seats in the late 1920s. The <em>parachuted cell</em> design was tested on 25 August 1929 in Paris and got the design patented.</li>
  <li>The technique used before ejection seat was to simply jump out of the aircraft which in most cases was difficult as it would cause injury and was dangerous.</li>
  <li>As with most of the things, World War II led to the development and perfection of parachutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Heinkel</strong> and <strong>SAAB</strong> developed the ejection seat independently. These early models were compressed air powered seats. <strong>Heinkel HE 280</strong>, the prototype jet fighter, had an ejection system built into it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3>
<p>If there arises a scenario where ejection is imminent, the command “eject” is used as an early warning that a possible ejection is coming up in next 30 or so seconds. At the critical moment, the command “bailout” is used and the crew ejects.</p>

<p>The sequence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the pilot activates the ejection system, first the canopy is blown off or opened.</li>
  <li>The pilot and the seat are launched through the opening.</li>
  <li>During ejection, a catapult propels the seat up the rails and then the rocket engine takes over.</li>
  <li>The canopy forms another part of the ejection system. Most of the aircraft are designed in a way where the canopy is blown off the aircraft. In some cases to avoid delay or seat hitting the canopy, a specially designed canopy filled with explosive charges embedded within the acrylic canopy which when initiated, shatters the canopy above and the seat is ejected a few seconds later.</li>
  <li>In some other aircraft without canopy, the seats are ejected through hatches. B-52 bombers had ejection seats that were ejected through the hatches, four in the roof and two on the floor.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-is-ejection-seat">What is ejection seat?</h3>
<p>The ejection seat is a safety mechanism primarily used in aircraft to save a pilot or a passenger by propelling the seat out of the disabled aircraft.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An explosive charge or rocket is used to propel the seat to a safe distance and a parachute takes care of the rest of the journey down to the ground.</li>
  <li><strong>Everald Calthorp</strong> who earlier had invented parachutes devised an ejection seat that used compressed air.</li>
  <li>Romanian inventor <strong>Ananstase Dragomir</strong> proposed the modern layout for ejection seats in the late 1920s. The <em>parachuted cell</em> design was tested on 25 August 1929 in Paris and got the design patented.</li>
  <li>The technique used before ejection seat was to simply jump out of the aircraft which in most cases was difficult as it would cause injury and was dangerous.</li>
  <li>As with most of the things, World War II led to the development and perfection of parachutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Heinkel</strong> and <strong>SAAB</strong> developed the ejection seat independently. These early models were compressed air powered seats. <strong>Heinkel HE 280</strong>, the prototype jet fighter, had an ejection system built into it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3>
<p>If there arises a scenario where ejection is imminent, the command “eject” is used as an early warning that a possible ejection is coming up in next 30 or so seconds. At the critical moment, the command “bailout” is used and the crew ejects.</p>

<p>The sequence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the pilot activates the ejection system, first the canopy is blown off or opened.</li>
  <li>The pilot and the seat are launched through the opening.</li>
  <li>During ejection, a catapult propels the seat up the rails and then the rocket engine takes over.</li>
  <li>The canopy forms another part of the ejection system. Most of the aircraft are designed in a way where the canopy is blown off the aircraft. In some cases to avoid delay or seat hitting the canopy, a specially designed canopy filled with explosive charges embedded within the acrylic canopy which when initiated, shatters the canopy above and the seat is ejected a few seconds later.</li>
  <li>In some other aircraft without canopy, the seats are ejected through hatches. B-52 bombers had ejection seats that were ejected through the hatches, four in the roof and two on the floor.</li>
</ul>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="history-of-toilets">History of toilets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Toilets and sewers came into being as early as 3000 B.C.</li>
  <li>Mohenjodaro had earliest forms of toilet which resembled western toilets. Waste was deposited into pits or drains.</li>
  <li>In Harappa, a primitive form of water cleaning toilet was used which utilised flowing water to remove waste.</li>
  <li>Indus valley civilisation is well known for its network of sewers built under the ground.</li>
  <li>In the west, toilets that used water were built in the Orkney Islands on the northern tip of Scotland dating back to 3100 B.C - 2500 B.C.</li>
  <li>By 18th century B.C, toilets made appearances in Egypt, parts of Greece and Persia.</li>
  <li>Remains of toilets have been found from a Neolithic village in Vietnam dating back to 1500 B.C.</li>
  <li>Romans used public toilets along with public baths. These toilets were elevated platforms over sewers that were periodically flushed with water.</li>
  <li>Greeks and Romans also used <strong>Chamber Pots</strong> that were brought to public meal and drinking parties! Yeah, let them sink in for a moment.</li>
  <li>Han dynasty in China used <strong>Pig toilets</strong>. An outhouse was connected to a pigsty and the waste was consumed by the pigs. Hence the reputation Pork!</li>
  <li>During medieval times <strong>Garderobes</strong> were used as toilets, especially in Castles. Basically, a flat piece of wood or stone spanning from wall to wall with a hole in the middle. The holes were placed above pipes that dropped the waste outside the wall of the room. Usually these rooms were placed away from bedrooms to prevent smell and sometimes near kitchen or fireplace for warmth.</li>
  <li>Chamber pots were also extensively used in medieval times. The waste was excreted into pots made of metal or ceramic and they were emptied into street gutters.</li>
  <li>Rural Denmark, until 18<sup>th</sup> century, had no toilets. Instead, people defecated in farmlands so that the waste could be used as manure for the crop. Cycle of life!</li>
  <li>By 16<sup>th</sup> century, to avoid the clogging on gutters around the streets, cesspools and cesspits were dug near houses to collect waste. The toilet was connected to the cesspools by a pipe with sometimes water to clean the waste. <strong>Gong farmers</strong> cleaned out these pits by pumping out the liquid waste and removing the solid waste. This was done mostly during the night and the solid waste came to be known as the <strong>night soil</strong> and was used as manure.</li>
  <li>While water closets were something that wealthy could afford, the working class and in towns and cities, <strong>Privy Midden</strong> and <strong>Pail closets</strong> were used. Privy midden was an outhouse with a waste dump and had a bad reputation for being difficult to clean. Pail closet was a toilet with a bucket into which people defecated and local authorities cleaned out the buckets on regular basis and either got rid of the waste or used it as manure.</li>
  <li>It was not until early 19<sup>th</sup> century that public sanitation was considered a necessity and mid 19<sup>the</sup> century is when underground sewer networks were constructed to carry away waste.</li>
  <li>The building codes in London did not require an indoor toilet until after the First World War.</li>
  <li>Water closet, although invented during the Tudor era in 1596 by Sir John Harington, Queen Elizabeth’s godson, it wasn’t perfected until 1770 by <strong>Alexander Cumming</strong> and <strong>Joseph Bramah</strong>. Around 1850s, water cosets started moving inside the houses.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-india">In India</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Manusmriti: At least 40 hands distance is to be observed while urinating near a river or temple and defecation should be at least at a distance of 400 hands.</li>
  <li>Toilets were constructed only after Mughals came to India.</li>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="chocolate">Chocolate</h3>
<p>Chocolate is a magic stuff made of roasted ground cocoa seeds. One of the most popular dessert ingredients. Needs no introduction, of course, chocolate can be used in a solid, liquid (choco syrup) and in many other forms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The word <strong>chocolate</strong> comes from the <strong>Nahuatl</strong> word <em>chocolātl</em>. Nahuatl was spoken in the valley of Mexico during the Spanish conquest of Aztec in the 16th century.</li>
  <li>Chocolate has been very popular in desserts and other forms of food and African countries are leading producers of cocoa even though it originated in the Americas.</li>
  <li>Western Africa produces about two-thirds of the world’s cocoa and Ivory coast produces about half of it.</li>
  <li>Types of chocolate:</li>
  <li><strong>Dark chocolate</strong>: Dark chocolate is a mixture of cocoa, fat and sugar. More the amount of cocoa, more bitter the chocolate.</li>
  <li><strong>Unsweetened chocolate</strong>: This is unsweetened chocolate liquor called bitter or baking chocolate. It’s pure ground cocoa.</li>
  <li><strong>Milk chocolate</strong>: Milk chocolate either contains milk powder of condensed milk with a minimum of 20-25% of cocoa depending on the country.</li>
  <li><strong>White chocolate</strong>: White chocolate contains cocoa butter, milk and sugar and no cocoa solids, that differentiates it from milk chocolates.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the early history of chocolate (around 4000 years), chocolate was mostly used as a bitter beverage.</li>
  <li>Evidence has been found that chocolate was cultivated in present-day Mexico around 1900 B.C.</li>
  <li>Also believed to be fermented and consumed an alcoholic beverage around 1400 B.C.</li>
  <li>Christopher Columbus came across cocoa beans during his fourth mission to Americas when his crew seized a native canoe filled with cocoa.</li>
  <li>Spanish explorer <strong>Hernán Cortés</strong> came across chocolate in its true form in the court of Montezuma, who was the ruler of Tenochtitlan, capital of Aztec. The cocoa beverage was served in the gold cups and supposedly gave them power over women. The drink was said to be frothy with a very unpleasant taste but was highly esteemed by the natives.</li>
  <li>Chocolate made its way into Europe following the Spanish conquest of Aztec. It was used initially as medicine to treat abdominal pain and later sugar or honey was added to make it into a sweetened beverage and was served in the court. In the next century, chocolate became a favourite in Europe.</li>
  <li>Chocolate cultivation saw a rise and resulted in an increase in the slave trade. The <strong>Chocolaterie Lombart</strong>, was the first chocolate company established in 1760 in France.</li>
  <li>Industrial revolution accelerated the production of Cocoa.</li>
  <li><strong>Coenraad van Houten</strong>, a Dutch chemist, added alkaline salts to chocolate which helped in reducing its bitterness. In 1828, he devieda method to remove much of the cacao butter from chocolate liquor which made production cheaper and gave more consistency to chocolate.</li>
  <li>This cocoa called <strong>Dutch cocoa</strong> also helped in creating chocolate in solid form in 1847 when <strong>Joseph Fry</strong> added melted cacao butter back to chocolate to make it mouldable.</li>
  <li>In mid 1875, <strong>Daniel Peter</strong>, a Swiss chocolatier, invented milk chocolate by adding powdered chocolate back to the liquor. Powdered milk used in this process was invented by <strong>Henri Nestlé</strong>, founder of Nestlé. They later created the Nestlé company.</li>
  <li>The conching machine, a surface scraping mixer and agitator was invented in the year 1879 by <strong>Rudolf Lindt</strong>, a Swiss chocolate manufacturer, which further improved the quality of the chocolate by giving is a smooth <em>melt-in-mouth</em> consistency.</li>
  <li>In England, <strong>Cadbury</strong> had started manufacturing boxed chocolates in 1868.</li>
  <li>During the <em>World Columbian Exposition</em> at Chicago held in 1893, <strong>Milton S. Hershey</strong>, American chocolatier and philanthropist purchased the chocolate processing equipment and started Hershey’s.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chocolate is made from cocoa beans. There are about 40 cocoa beans in a cocoa fruit. These beans are dried and fermented. The tree is called <strong>Cacao</strong>.</li>
  <li>Three main varieties are <strong>Criollo</strong>, <strong>Forastero</strong> and <strong>Trinitario</strong>.</li>
  <li>Criollo is the rarest of the three and is native to Central America, Carribean and Northern part of South America. They are difficult to grow and provide very low yield.</li>
  <li>Forastero is the most commonly grown version and commonly found in Amazon basin and Africa. They have a more chocolaty flavour which lasts for a shorter amount of time.</li>
  <li>Trinitario is a hybrid of Criollo and Forastero which originated in Trinidad.</li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong>: Cacao pods are removed from the tree and the beans with pulp are removed and placed in bins to enable fermentation. The fermentation takes up to a week and results in the chocolate flavour. Pods are harvested when they are ripe or the cocoa content would be less. Dried beans are transferred to a facility where the shell is removed to extract the nib. The nib is then ground and liquefied to chocolate in purest form as chocolate liquor. Cocoa solids and cocoa butter can be extracted from this liquor.</li>
  <li><strong>Conching</strong>: Conching is processed by which the texture of the chocolate is smoothened. Chonche is a container which contains metal beads that act as grinders. The frictional heat keeps the chocolate in liquid form. High quality chocolate is conched for 72 hours and lesser grade chocolates are conched for 5-6 hours. The conched chocolate is then stored in containers at 40-50 degree Celsius.</li>
  <li><strong>Tempering</strong>: Tempering is a process to prevent uncontrolled crystallisation of cocoa butter in chocolate which results in crystals of varying sizes. Cocoa butter gave the chocolate its rigidity when solid at room temperature and when heated, the crystalline structure of cocoa butter breaks down and chocolate becomes liquid.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Chocolate is very susceptible to temperature and humidity changes.</li>
</ul>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="evo-what-evolution">Evo… what? Evolution</h3>
<p>The theory of evolution states that chemicals randomly orgnaised themselves into a self replicating molecule. The simple self-replicating molecule then underwent mutation and formed the complex organisms that ever existed on the earth. The theory consists of basicaly three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is possible for the DNA of an organism to occasionally change, or mutate.</li>
  <li>The change brought about by a mutation is either beneficial, harmful or neutral.</li>
  <li>As mutations occur and spread over long periods of time, they cause new species to form.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mutations have seen to be affecting E-Coli bacteria which under right circumstances can replicate itself in every 20 minutes. By the process of mutation, certain bacteria can evolve which can be resistant to certain antibiotics. This is similar to certain insects becoming immune to DDT.</p>

<h3 id="domestication">Domestication</h3>
<p>But not all animals can be domesticated. Out of the 148 major terrestrial mammals, only 14 were domesticated and gthe theory is the for a species to be able to be domesticated, there are six charecterisitcs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Efficient diet</strong>: Should be able to feed on cheap accessible food.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick growth rate</strong>: Should be able to mature and reproduce at a faster rate.</li>
  <li><strong>Ability to breed in captivity</strong>: Should be able to breed under domestic conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Pleasant disposition</strong>: Should not be dangerous.</li>
  <li><strong>Tendency not to panic</strong>: These animals should not have a tenency to panic.</li>
  <li><strong>Social structure</strong>: Should follow a social structure like pack animals where a certain heirarchy is respected.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the reason why animals like Zebra are difficult to be domesticated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dogs are amongst the oldest domesticated animals. Dogs were domesticated before cattle and even plants.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changes-in-animals-post-domestication">Changes in animals post domestication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Animals become more tame, in some cases grow floppy ears, tail etc.</li>
  <li>Neural crest hypothesis suggests that deficits in the Neural Crest Cells which are the embryonic stem cells that produce various tissue types during embryogenesis.</li>
  <li>These changes do not usually get reversed if the animal is release back to the wild. <strong>Dingo</strong> being an example.</li>

  <li><strong>Commensal pathway</strong>: Animals like dogs and cats who were attracted to human ways for resources available with human beings. Chickens too!</li>
  <li><strong>Prey pathway</strong>: Animals like the livestock belong to a category that were once hunted for food. They were domestiated mostly for food.</li>
  <li><strong>Directed pathway</strong>: These include animals like horses,donkeys etc that could be used for purposes like transporation etc. and no necessarily for meat.</li>

<p>The pathways need not be exclusive. Animals may have followed multiple pathways.</p>

<h3 id="the-russian-domesticated-fox">The Russian Domesticated Fox</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dmitry Belyayev</strong>: Belyayev conducted the <em>The Silver Fox Experiment</em>. He believed that all the domesticated animals have been selected for tameness. He conducted an experiment which took up most the last 26 years of his life.</li>
  <li>He used a Siver fox, which is a variant of the <em>Red Fox</em> because he felt that it is more social and related to dog.</li>
  <li>In 1958, he directed his assistant Lyudmila Trut to visit various fur farm in Soviet Union and select the calmest foxes she could find.</li>
  <li>Experiment began with 30 male foxes and 100 vixens, most of them from a commercial fur farm in Estonia.</li>
  <li>They were bred solely for tameness and weren’t trained to ensure that the resulting tameness was due to genetics and not due to training.</li>
  <li>Darwin had stated that domesticated animals tend to have smaller heads, floppier ears, curlier tails and spotty coats to appear juvenile to humans. Belyayev wanted to test this theory as well.</li>
  <li>Genetics had recieved some bad rap in post war Soviet, so Belyayev spoke about his research in terms of Phsycology rather than mention genes.</li>
  <li>Starting at month one throughout, the foxes were tested for their reactions to the experimenter. They would pet and handle the foxes and at when they reach sexual maturity at 7-8 months, they are assigned an overall tameness score.</li>
  <li>During the end of 7-8 months they were categorised onto three classes based on their tameness index.</li>
  <li>An <em>Elite</em> class was later added that showed even more tameness and friendliness than class 1.</li>
  <li>The experiment started showing rapid results and by the fourth generation, researchers were able to find results that was up to their expectations.</li>
  <li>An employee took a fox home and it responded to it’s name the same a way a dog does.</li>
  <li>By tenth generation 18% of the population was elite group and by 20th generaion this number had risen to 35% and to around 80% in 2009.</li>
  <li>After around 40 generations, Belyayev’s foxes have floppy ears, transformation in skull size, curly tails, mating periods, changes in fur colour and even lost their fox odour.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="evo-what-evolution">Evo… what? Evolution</h3>
<p>The theory of evolution states that chemicals randomly orgnaised themselves into a self replicating molecule. The simple self-replicating molecule then underwent mutation and formed the complex organisms that ever existed on the earth. The theory consists of basicaly three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is possible for the DNA of an organism to occasionally change, or mutate.</li>
  <li>The change brought about by a mutation is either beneficial, harmful or neutral.</li>
  <li>As mutations occur and spread over long periods of time, they cause new species to form.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mutations have seen to be affecting E-Coli bacteria which under right circumstances can replicate itself in every 20 minutes. By the process of mutation, certain bacteria can evolve which can be resistant to certain antibiotics. This is similar to certain insects becoming immune to DDT.</p>

<h3 id="domestication">Domestication</h3>
<p>But not all animals can be domesticated. Out of the 148 major terrestrial mammals, only 14 were domesticated and gthe theory is the for a species to be able to be domesticated, there are six charecterisitcs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Efficient diet</strong>: Should be able to feed on cheap accessible food.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick growth rate</strong>: Should be able to mature and reproduce at a faster rate.</li>
  <li><strong>Ability to breed in captivity</strong>: Should be able to breed under domestic conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Pleasant disposition</strong>: Should not be dangerous.</li>
  <li><strong>Tendency not to panic</strong>: These animals should not have a tenency to panic.</li>
  <li><strong>Social structure</strong>: Should follow a social structure like pack animals where a certain heirarchy is respected.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the reason why animals like Zebra are difficult to be domesticated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dogs are amongst the oldest domesticated animals. Dogs were domesticated before cattle and even plants.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changes-in-animals-post-domestication">Changes in animals post domestication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Animals become more tame, in some cases grow floppy ears, tail etc.</li>
  <li>Neural crest hypothesis suggests that deficits in the Neural Crest Cells which are the embryonic stem cells that produce various tissue types during embryogenesis.</li>
  <li>These changes do not usually get reversed if the animal is release back to the wild. <strong>Dingo</strong> being an example.</li>
  <li>Reversion almost never happens. <strong>Dingos</strong> are classic examples where in spite of staying apart from humans for thousands of years, thay haven’t shown any significant brain growth than normal dogs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="paths-of-animals-into-domestication">Paths of animals into domestication</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Commensal pathway</strong>: Animals like dogs and cats who were attracted to human ways for resources available with human beings. Chickens too!</li>

  <li><strong>Directed pathway</strong>: These include animals like horses,donkeys etc that could be used for purposes like transporation etc. and no necessarily for meat.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Body modification where ink, dye or pigment is inserted into the dermis layer of the skin to change the colour.</li>
  <li>Was considered uncivilised in the west until recently, tattoos carried symbolic meanings in many societies and culture since early ages.</li>
  <li>By 20<sup>th</sup> century, tattooing became more popular art in the west.</li>
  <li>The word tattoo, or tattow in the 18th century, from the Samoan word tatau, meaning “to strike”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In Europe, tattooing is speculated to have been practised during the upper palaeolithic period (Old stone age, between 50,000 and 10,000 years).</li>
  <li>From evidence gained from the mummified skin, tattoos have been practised since the Neolithic times (new stone age. Approx 10,200 BC - 2000 BC).</li>
  <li>Direct evidence for the existence of tattoos exists only as far as 4000 years in history.</li>
  <li>Earliest tattoed human body is that of <strong>Ötzi the iceman</strong> who lived between 3370 and 3100 BC and was found in the Ötztal Alps between Austria and Italy. Ötzi had a total of 61 tattoos in the form of groups of parallel lines.</li>
  <li>Several other mummified bodies have been recovered from various parts of the world including Egypt, South America, Siberia and Alaska.</li>
  <li>Chinese cemeteries in the Xinjiang region have been known to contain tattooed mummies dating back to 2100-550 BC.</li>
  <li>It was considered to be a barbaric practice and often prisoners were forcefully tattood on face</li>
  <li>Greeks use tattoos for spy communications and used distinctive markings on their bodies to identify the ranks.</li>
  <li>Tattooing was introduced to Japan by the Ainu people of East Asia. They had smiling tattoos on the faces of women.</li>
  <li>In Europe, Britons, Danes and Norse used tattoos to identify the family.</li>
  <li>Emperor Constantine banned tattoo in AD 330</li>
  <li>Pope Hadrian banned tattoo in the year 747 A.D. during the second council of Nicea and post Norman invasion in 1066, tattoos lost popularity from 12<sup>th</sup> to 16<sup>th</sup> centuries.</li>
  <li>During this time tattoos were used to identify criminals in Japan. Lines were added during subsequent lines to eventually spell out the word <em>dog</em>. Later tattoo became an art form and popular among the middle and lower class as ornate full body clothing was restricted to the royalty.</li>
  <li><strong>William Dampier</strong>, a sailor and explorer was responsible for the revival of tattoos back in the west. He brought Polynesian Prince Giolo to London in 1691 who was completely tattooed.</li>
  <li><strong>James Cook</strong> has been credited with bringing the word tattoo back to Europe after his travels to New Zealand and Tahiti.</li>
  <li>Nazis forcibly tattooed the prisoners for identification purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tattoo-ink">Tattoo Ink</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Created from compounds of heavy metals like Cadmium, Chromium or Lead with Manganese or Aluminium salts.</li>
  <li>Multiple needles penetrate into the dermis and deposit ink.</li>
  <li>Immune systems (white blood cells) tries to engulf the pigment granule. Since the pigment granule is larger in size, the blood cells cannot easily remove the ink particles.</li>
  <li>Over times, tattoo fades as the pigments are carried to the liver through lymph nodes and removed from the body.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tattoo machine uses needles, circular formation for lines and brush like formation for shading.</li>
  <li>Types of machines:
    <ul>
      <li>Rotary: The rotary motion of a motor is converted into piston-like motion of the needle</li>
      <li>Coil type: An electromagnetic current is used to power the needle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ink passes from the needles to the dermis layer of the skin.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="removal">Removal</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lasers with frequencies in the range of picoseconds are used.</li>
  <li>Laser shatters the pigments and reduces the size which makes it easier for the white blood cells to remove the particles from the body.</li>
  <li>The shattering happens as the laser heats up one part of the ink particle resulting in a heat gradient and hence the particle rips apart.</li>
  <li>Frosting happens on the skin results from the shock wave that forms on the surface.</li>
</ul>

				<itunes:subtitle>In this episode, we discuss the history of vaccum cleaner.</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="vacuum-cleaner">Vacuum Cleaner</h3>
<p>A vacuum cleaner, also known as a sweeper or hoover, is a device that uses an air pump to create a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors, and from other surfaces.
Basically, it is a device which sucks your home tidy.</p>

<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2300 B.C. - First rudimentary forms of broom and cleaning tools came into existence</li>
  <li>1797 - Levi Dickenson devised a broom with the use of sorghum bristles. The sorghum broom business exploded and by 1860 sorghum got the name broomcorn.</li>
  <li>1858 - Hiram Herrick patented a carpet sweeper which was the first American patent for a carpet sweeper. The device consisted of a rolling broom and dustpan.</li>
  <li>1860 - Daniel Hess produced a carpet sweeper which used suction through a rotating brush and bellows. It was completely manual and that is probably the reason why it was not successful. It was the first rudimentary design of a vacuum cleaner.</li>
  <li>1869 - Ives W. McCaffe came up with ‘Whirlwind’, the first manual vacuum cleaner which was upright. The belt driven, hand-powered device was sold for a retail price of $25 which would be around a whopping $450 in the present. This proved to be the reason for the unsuccessful run of the device.</li>
  <li>1898 - A gasoline powered blower was developed by John S. Thurman, which had to be horse-drawn to locations due to its bulky nature. It was a moderately successful device which relied on blowing the dust into a receptacle instead of suction.</li>
  <li>1901 - Hubert Cecil Booth from England manufactured the ‘Puffing Billy’ which was also a bulky device but relied on suction. The gasoline-powered machine was later upgraded to electric power. It used a cloth filter to collect the dust. Puffing Billy was extremely successful and hotels started installing it in their compound. It was once also used to clean West Minister Abbey.</li>
  <li>During the same time, David T. Kenney came up with a vacuum cleaner which was powered by steam engine. But it did not succeed in getting much business due to its weight of 4000 pounds.</li>
  <li>1906 - Walter Griffiths came up with the first portable vacuum cleaner which used bellows and flexible pipe for suction.</li>
  <li>1906 -  Jame B. Kirby developed a vacuum cleaner that used water for dirt separation instead of a filter. It was called ‘Domestic Cyclone’.</li>
  <li>1907 - James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Ohio devised a vacuum cleaner with the use of a broom, electric rotating motor, and a pillowcase for dust collection. Because he did not get the funding, he sold the patent to William Henry Hoover in 1908.</li>
  <li>1926 - Hoover redesigned the vacuum cleaner by adding a steel box for sturdiness and disposal filter bags to collect dust. It became a mainstay in the market</li>
  <li>1997 - A Swedish company came up with ‘Electrolux Trilobite’, the first autonomous cordless robotic vacuum cleaner. This was made available to the consumers in 2001.</li>
  <li>2004 - A British company came up with ‘Airider’, a vacuum cleaner which uses the technology of hovercrafts to float above the floor.</li>

<p>A vacuum cleaner, also known as a sweeper or hoover, is a device that uses an air pump to create a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors, and from other surfaces.
Basically, it is a device which sucks your home tidy.</p>

<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2300 B.C. - First rudimentary forms of broom and cleaning tools came into existence</li>
  <li>1797 - Levi Dickenson devised a broom with the use of sorghum bristles. The sorghum broom business exploded and by 1860 sorghum got the name broomcorn.</li>
  <li>1858 - Hiram Herrick patented a carpet sweeper which was the first American patent for a carpet sweeper. The device consisted of a rolling broom and dustpan.</li>
  <li>1860 - Daniel Hess produced a carpet sweeper which used suction through a rotating brush and bellows. It was completely manual and that is probably the reason why it was not successful. It was the first rudimentary design of a vacuum cleaner.</li>
  <li>1869 - Ives W. McCaffe came up with ‘Whirlwind’, the first manual vacuum cleaner which was upright. The belt driven, hand-powered device was sold for a retail price of $25 which would be around a whopping $450 in the present. This proved to be the reason for the unsuccessful run of the device.</li>
  <li>1898 - A gasoline powered blower was developed by John S. Thurman, which had to be horse-drawn to locations due to its bulky nature. It was a moderately successful device which relied on blowing the dust into a receptacle instead of suction.</li>
  <li>1901 - Hubert Cecil Booth from England manufactured the ‘Puffing Billy’ which was also a bulky device but relied on suction. The gasoline-powered machine was later upgraded to electric power. It used a cloth filter to collect the dust. Puffing Billy was extremely successful and hotels started installing it in their compound. It was once also used to clean West Minister Abbey.</li>
  <li>During the same time, David T. Kenney came up with a vacuum cleaner which was powered by steam engine. But it did not succeed in getting much business due to its weight of 4000 pounds.</li>
  <li>1906 - Walter Griffiths came up with the first portable vacuum cleaner which used bellows and flexible pipe for suction.</li>
  <li>1906 -  Jame B. Kirby developed a vacuum cleaner that used water for dirt separation instead of a filter. It was called ‘Domestic Cyclone’.</li>
  <li>1907 - James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Ohio devised a vacuum cleaner with the use of a broom, electric rotating motor, and a pillowcase for dust collection. Because he did not get the funding, he sold the patent to William Henry Hoover in 1908.</li>
  <li>1926 - Hoover redesigned the vacuum cleaner by adding a steel box for sturdiness and disposal filter bags to collect dust. It became a mainstay in the market</li>
  <li>1997 - A Swedish company came up with ‘Electrolux Trilobite’, the first autonomous cordless robotic vacuum cleaner. This was made available to the consumers in 2001.</li>
  <li>2004 - A British company came up with ‘Airider’, a vacuum cleaner which uses the technology of hovercrafts to float above the floor.</li>

<ul>
  <li>No introduction required.</li>
  <li>It is a colloidal emulsion which is made into a foam by incorporating air and then frozen.</li>
  <li>Ice cream is a mixture of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air.</li>
  <li>The mixture is stirred well to incorporate air and is cooled below the freezing point and stored as semi-solid foam stored at low temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>The accepted composition of ice-cream in the US according to Wikipedia (all percentages by weight):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Greater than 10% milkfat and usually between 10% and as high as 16% fat in some premium ice creams</li>
  <li>9 to 12% milk solids-not-fat: this component, also known as the serum solids, contains the proteins (caseins and whey proteins) and carbohydrates (lactose) found in milk</li>
  <li>12 to 16% sweeteners: usually a combination of sucrose and glucose-based corn syrup sweeteners</li>
  <li>0.2 to 0.5% stabilisers and emulsifiers</li>
  <li>55% to 64% water, which comes from the milk or other ingredients.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The ice cream was consumed during the Achaemenid Empire in 500 BC. Ice was mixed with flavours and consumed during the summertime.</li>
  <li>Persians also invented a dish with ice, rose water and vermicelli which was a primitive version of <strong>Falooda</strong>. This was mostly reserved for the Royals.</li>
  <li>Greeks weren’t behind, they also invented snow mixed with honey and fruits which was also sold in the markets of Athens.</li>
  <li>Hippocrates advocated eating ice.</li>
  <li>China invented the real primitive form of ice-cream using milk and rice around 200 B.C. Snow and saltpetre was poured outside of containers filled with syrups to reduce the melting point.</li>
  <li>A few centuries later, during the time of Nero, ice was bought from the mountains to Rome and combines with fruits and served as delicacies.</li>
  <li>Marco Polo bought the recipe back to Europe.</li>
  <li>In India, ice was shipped in from Hindukush mountains and used in sorbets and in making <em>Kulfi</em> which came into existence around 16<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li>Italian Dutchess Catherine de Medici married Henry II of France in 1533 and bought some Italian chef’s along with her who made flavoured ice. Flavoured ice became popular in France.</li>
  <li>Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream café in 1651 in Paris which became popular. During the next 50 years around 250 cafés opened in Paris.</li>
  <li>Charles I of England was fond of ice-cream and paid his chef to not to give away the recipe.</li>
  <li>By the mid-eighteenth century, ice-cream became popular in the United States as well. George Washington was a big fan.</li>
  <li>By the mid-nineteenth century, ice-cream became inexpensive and available to common people. This was mainly due to Carlo Gatti setting up a stand outside of Strand in 1851. He sold a scoop for one penny. He imported ice from Norway.</li>
  <li>Agnes Marshall popularised many ice-cream recipes in England.</li>
  <li>Ice-cream appeared in Greece in 20<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="production">Production</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Before refrigerators, ice-cream was meant only for the rich upper class. Ice was hard to come by.</li>
  <li>Ice-cream was made in using the <em>pot freeze</em> method where a large bowl was kept in a tub of ice and salt.</li>
  <li>The mixture of salt and ice cooled the temperature of the ingredients within the bowl.</li>
  <li>Salt partially melts the ice allowing it to absorb the latent heat and thus brings the temperature of the ingredients below the freezing point of water. This helps in freezing milk which has a lower freezing point.</li>
  <li>First, large-scale production in the US was by Jacob Fussell of Baltimore.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sundae</strong>: A type of ice-cream with one or more scoop of cream and syrup. It was a variation of ice-cream soda and due to restrictions on consuming soda on Sundays, soda was replaced with syrup. To avoid religious conflict changed the spelling to “ice-cream sundae”.</li>
  <li><strong>Ice-cream cone</strong>: Agnes Marshall’s cookery book had a recipe for serving ice cream in cones, but the practice is believed to be existing before that.</li>
  <li><strong>Faludah or Faloodeh</strong>: Popular Iranian ice-cream with vermicelli, rose water and sugar syrup.</li>
  <li><strong>Gelato</strong>: Italian frozen dessert with a lower milk fat content than ice cream.</li>
  <li><strong>Ice-cream sandwich</strong>: A bar of ice-cream sandwiched between two cookies.</li>
  <li><strong>Frozen yoghurt</strong>: Made with yoghurt instead of milk or cream.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="present-day">Present day</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The US is the major consumer of ice-cream with about 23 litres per capita followed by Australia and New Zealand.</li>
  <li>India is one of the largest producers of ice-cream and most of the production is consumed domestically.</li>

<p>Jet engine is a type of internal combustion engine that produces thrust based on a fast moving discharge of hot gases, widely used on airplanes.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hero of Alexandria built Aeopile which was the earliest for of jet engine dating back to 1<sup>st</sup> century A.D.</li>
  <li>It was a steam turbine which rotated when a central water container is heated. Much like a lawn sprinkler.</li>
  <li>Was more of a curiousity thing and did not have practical application.</li>
  <li>Chinese invented rocket fireworks in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, but since these were inefficient, did not develop for few more centuries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-need">The need</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The propeller driven airplanes had their limitations in terms of max speed that could be achieved.</li>
  <li>Pressure build up while approaching sound barrier caused many of these planes to crash.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-components">Key components</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Air intake</li>
  <li>Compressor</li>
  <li>Gas turbine</li>
  <li>Combustion chamber</li>
  <li>Exhaust nozzle</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-jet-engines">Types of Jet Engines</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Turbojet</strong>: Basically a gas turbine that compresser air through an inlet and compressor. Fuel is mixed with th compressed air in the combustion chamber and the exhaust gases propel the engine forward and also run the compressor. All the ir passes through the inlet into the compressor, the combustion chamber and then through the turbines before escaping out.</li>
  <li><strong>Turboprop</strong>: Turboprop uses the exhaust to mainly drive a propeller that provides the thrust to move the engine forward. In this type of engine, the jet thrust is augmented by the propeller. They perform extremely well at low speeds. Another type of turboprop called turboshaft utilises all the power to run the propeller and produces almost no jet exhaust. This mainly used to power helicopters.</li>
  <li><strong>Turbofan</strong>: Turbofan is essentially a turbojet with a giant fan in the front of the compressor. The fan draws more ait and while a part of it enters the inlet, the rest of it goes around the engine providing additional thrust in a way similar to a turboprop. This is the way more efficient than a turbojet. The fan allows greater thrust at low speeds. In passenger jets, the engines have a biger fan and helps in reduced noise and increased efficiency whereas in military aircraft where flight is usually supersonic and noise isn’t a factor, turbofans with smaller fans are used to reduce drag and increase the menouverability of the craft.</li>
  <li><strong>Ramjet</strong>: Ramjet does not use a compressor instead depends on the air pressure to build up at the inlet duct. As a result, a ramject cannot work in subsonic speeds and requires it to be accelerated to supersonic speeds by a turbojet or a rocket engine. Practical applications are in missiles and unmanned vehicles.</li>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h2 id="its-mighty">It’s mighty!</h2>
<p>Pizza is undoubtedly one of the most loved food in the world. About 7 billion pizzas are consumed across the world every year.</p>

<h3 id="history">History:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Its history can be traced back to the streets of Naples, Italy in the Dark Ages.</li>
  <li>The introduction of tomato and mozzarella cheese revolutionised the art of pizza making.</li>
  <li>The first pizzeria was set up in 1830 and is called Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba. Yes, it still exists.</li>
  <li>As per legend, Margherita Pizza was invented by Raffaele Esposito in 1889 for Queen Margherita. It was made using tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves which represents the colours of the Italian flag.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pizza-and-usa">Pizza and USA:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>G. Lombardi, the first pizzeria in the US was set up in 1905</li>
  <li>World War II popularised pizza in the country.</li>
  <li>5 billion pizzas consumed by Americans every year.</li>
  <li>251,770,000 pounds of pepperoni consumed by Americans every year.</li>
  <li>It is a $32 billion business in the country every year.</li>
  <li>Pizza results in 41% increase in cheese consumption since 1995 in US.</li>
  <li>NASA 3D printed a pizza in 2013 (What? Really?!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="health-benefits">Health Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike popular belief, pizza is not always unhealthy. If it is made with the right ingredients it can have many health benefits. It reduces the risk of oesophagal, colon, oral cavity, and pharyngeal cancer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="random-facts">Random facts:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First pineapple pizza (Hawaiian pizza) and the frozen pizza was made in 1962.</li>
  <li>Largest pizza was made in 2012 in Rome and it measured 1261 square metres.</li>
  <li>Dog Pizza, also known as Heaven Scent Pizza, is made using flour, carrots, celery, and parmesan cheese.</li>
  <li>Cambodian Happy Pizza is made using marijuana</li>
  <li>Some of the strange pizza flavours include potato chips, ice cream, beer, e-cigarette, and condoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are you waiting for? Go eat some pizza!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Formula one is the highest class of racing sanctioned by FIA.</li>
  <li>The inaugural season was in 1950.</li>
  <li>A season consists of races called Grand Prix (Grand Prize in French).</li>
  <li>“Formula” is set of rules to be followed by the manufacturers and the drivers.</li>
  <li>One of the fastest type of races owing to the aerodynamic design of cars.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grand Prix Motor Racing</strong>: A precursor to the modern day Formula One racing.</li>
  <li>Started in France in 1894. Involved racing from one town to the next.</li>
  <li>Evolved into endurance races.</li>
  <li>High rate of fatality owing to poor safety standards.</li>
  <li>Post World War II, evolved into Formula One.</li>
  <li>Was a medium for car manufacturers to promote their cars. French has special interest in motor cars.</li>
  <li>First racing took place on <strong>July 22, 1894</strong> organised by <strong>Le Petit Journal</strong> between Paris and Rouen distance of 126 km.</li>
  <li><strong>Count Jules-Albert de Dion</strong> won the race in 6 hours 48 minutes at an average speed of 19 km/h (12 mph) and 3 mins the 30s ahead of the runner-up.</li>
  <li><strong>James Gordon Bennett Jr.</strong>, who was the owner of New York Herald, started the Gordon Bennett cup which was an international event with countries participating against each other.</li>
  <li>Each country entered up to three cars in the even and the cars were fully manufactured in those particular countries.</li>
  <li>Each country had their racing colours (Green for UK, Red for Italy etc.).</li>
  <li>After fatalities in the Paris-Madrid race, a closed circuit was used in Ireland at Athy in 1903 and was the first closed circuit race.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grand-prix">Grand Prix</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automobile Club de France</strong> organised regular races that were called Grad Prix races starting 1906.</li>
  <li>A circuit which was roughly triangular in shape situated in Le Mans was used with a lap distance of 105 km.</li>
  <li>A total of six laps were required to be covered per day with a lap taking around an hour of each car.</li>
  <li>Use of the circuit was a direct result of the 1903 Paris-Madrid race which resulted in the death of drivers and pedestrians were killed.</li>
  <li>Races were mostly nationalistic and had cars with 50hp, 10-15L engines. Each car carried a mechanic along with a driver and they were the only ones allowed to work on the car.</li>
  <li>Renault won the Grand Prix by using detachable wheel rims developed by Michelin.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pre-world-war-ii-days">Pre World War II days</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Monaco Grand Prix was the first time race grid was determined by using qualifying time rather than using a lucky draw.</li>
  <li>By the late 1930s, mechanics had long gone and cars were single seaters. Also, they were 600hp 8 or 16 cylindered monsters by this time.</li>
  <li>Mercedes and Auto Union dominated due to support from Nazis.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="post-war">Post war</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Post war, Formula One took shape in 1950.</li>
  <li>Due to economic difficulties, 1952 and 53 races were held using Formula 2 cars.</li>
  <li>First Word Championship race was held on May 13 in Silverstone, UK.</li>
  <li>The first championship was won by Italian Giuseppe (Nino) Farina driving an Alfa Romeo in 1950 defeating Juan Manuel Fangio.</li>
  <li>Fangio later went on to win five world championships which were a record for 45 years until Schumacher broke the record in 2003.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-routine">The routine</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Usually 12 teams compete with two drivers each.</li>
  <li>Race weekend consists of <em>free practice</em>, <em>qualifying session</em> and <em>race</em>.</li>
  <li>To participate in a race, a driver should complete at least one lap in the free practice session.</li>
  <li>Free practice usually happens on Fridays except for Monaco Grand Prix, where the practice happens on Thursday and Fridays are reserved for other activities.</li>
  <li>Qualifying consists of three sessions namely <em>Q1, Q2 and Q3</em>. Cars are ranked according to their lap time.</li>
  <li>During Q1 and Q2, 7 drivers are eliminated respectively leaving 10 drivers in Q3.</li>
  <li>The driver with the fastest time gets the <em>pole</em> position - the first on the grid.</li>
  <li>After qualification, cars are inclosed park, meaning that no significant changes can be done to the settings.</li>
  <li>Top ten cars have to start using the same tires that they set the lap times on. In few cases they can be replaced by a set of similar tyres subject to approvals.</li>
  <li>On the race day, the cars are aligned on the grid according to the grid locations decided as per qualifying on the previous day.</li>
  <li>Race is usually held around 2 pm on the Sunday for most of the European races. Some races like Singapore and Abu Dhabi happen during the evenings.</li>
  <li>Number of laps is selected so that the total distance is more than 305 km except for Monaco where the minimum race distance is set at 260km. Also the race time cannot exceed 2 hours and in case that happens the race positions at the 2 hour mark would be considered to be the final grid positions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-car">The car</h2>

<h3 id="engine">Engine</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The chassis is made using carbon fibre and other ultralight materials to save weight and for safety.</li>
  <li>Minimum permissible weight is 728kg including the driver without fuel.</li>
  <li>Sometimes ballast was used to add weight and lower the center of gravity.</li>
  <li>Prior to 2006, cars had V10 engines with 3 litre engines producing close to 1000 hp with top speeds reaching 375kph.</li>
  <li>In 2006, FIA came up with a rule that stated all cars must have a naturally aspirated (no turbocharger or supercharger) 2.4 litre V8 engines. Turbochargers were banned in 1989.</li>
  <li>Since 2014, engines are 1.6l turbocharged for an improved fuel efficiency of 29%.</li>
  <li>In 2009 engines were limited to 18,000 rpm for engine reliability.</li>
  <li>Engines consume close to 450lof air per second.</li>
  <li>Engine is located between driver and the rear axle and forms a structural support of the car.</li>
  <li>In 2004, engines were required to last a race weekend and subsequently the number of engines that could be used for a season were reduced to 8 and now to 3. That means an engine has to last for more than one race which would reduce the cost and make the units more reliable.
-Fuel used is similar to normal petrol with a controlled mix and FIA requires fuel suppliers to submit samples for testing and can ask for a sample at any time during the course of a season.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transmission">Transmission</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All cars have a semi-automatic gearbox with 8 forward and 1 backward gears.</li>
  <li>Carbon-titanium is used to make gearbox and is connected right behind the engine.</li>
  <li>Paddles behind the steering wheels are used to upshift and downshift.</li>
  <li>Clutch is controlled by electro-hydraulics except when starting from a standstill when the driver operates a lever in the steering wheel.</li>
  <li>Limitations exist on the number of gearboxes over a season as well. Gearboxes must complete six consecutive races before being replaced.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steering-wheel">Steering wheel</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Steering wheel houses many controls including gear shift, rev. limiter, fuel mix controller etc.</li>
  <li>Data related to various parameters are also displayed in LCD displays on the wheel.</li>
  <li>They weight around 1.3kg and can cost up to $50,000.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tyres">Tyres</h3>
<p>Tyres used are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hypersoft</li>
  <li>Ultrasoft</li>
  <li>Supersoft</li>
  <li>Soft</li>
  <li>Medium</li>
  <li>Hard</li>
  <li>Superhard</li>
  <li>Intermediate(for partially wet conditions)</li>
  <li>Wet (rain tyres)
During rain, wet tyres can remove almost 250l of water a second from the track.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-systems">Other systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Aerodynamics are controlled by using spoilers in the front and rear.</li>
  <li>If the throttle is let go, the aerodynamic drag will slow down the car at the same rate at which a sports car decelerates under breaking.</li>
  <li>KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) is used to give the car additional boost and stores the energy dissipated while braking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-facts">Some facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Car costs anywhere between 6 to 8 millions.</li>
  <li>Around 800 parts.</li>
  <li>Engine normally lasts for few races. Earlier it was an engine per week. Revs up to 16,000 - 18,000 RPM.</li>
  <li>Tyres last for around 90-120 km.</li>
  <li>Can accelerate from 0 to 160 kph back to 0 in 4 sec.</li>
  <li>Drivers lose close to 3-4 kg every race.</li>
  <li>At 130 kph, car has a downforce equal to its weight and can go upside down in a tunnel. Flight principles reversed.</li>
  <li>Roughly 2600-3000 gear shifts, Monaco has the most number of shifts.</li>
  <li>1200 litres of fuel is used per race weekend. Efficiency of 70l/100km.</li>
  <li>Brake discs reach temperatures of 1000°C, exhaust pipe reaches 900°C and tyres reach 130°C during a race.</li>
  <li>Champagne tradition started in 1950, locals fans presented a three litre bottle of champagne to the race winner Fangio.</li>
  <li>In 1966, Jo Siffert in 24 hours of Le Mans opened a bottle of champagne which wasn’t sufficiently cooled. The cork flew up and resulted in the drink splashing on everyone. This tradition continues to this day with the exception of Bahrain Grand Prix where it champagne is replaced with sparkling fruit juice.</li>
  <li>In 2005, a BAR Honda car set an unofficial speed record of 413kph at Bonneville Speedway.</li>

				<itunes:subtitle>In this episode we discuss the history of Pioneer 10.</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: NASA was established in 1958 as opposed to 1959 as mentioned by Shankar.</em></p>

<p>Pioneer 10 (Pioneer F) was the first aircraft to give humans an insight into the planet Jupiter and its moons. It was the first mission to Jupiter. It was part of the Pioneer program, a series of United States unmanned space missions launched between 1958 and 1978.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives:</h3>
<p>Document Jupiter, its environment and its moon (mainly Europa, Callisto, Io, Ganymede) through photographs (Jovian System)
Study the solar wind, cosmic rays, heliosphere, and far reaches of the Solar System
Explore the atmosphere and radioactivity of the planet
Study the outer Solar System and heliosphere exploration
Study the asteroid belt</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Gary Flandro, an aerospace engineer, conceived a mission to exploit a rare outer planets’ alignment.
The space probe was manufactured by TRW Inc. They were given a combined $380 million contract in 1970 to build Pioneer 10 and 11.
It took 25 million man-hours
As per a TRW engineer, “This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.”</p>

<h3 id="spacecraft-and-design">Spacecraft and Design:</h3>
<p>Six 76-centimetres long panels attached to a 36-centimetres bus to form a hexagonal structure. It could host eight to eleven instruments which were protected in a honeycomb aluminium structure. The orientation of the probe was controlled by the use of propellant (conical scanning). Aluminized mylar and kapton blankets (insulation coating) for passive thermal control. It carried 36 kilograms of liquid hydrazine monopropellant with a total launch mass of 260 kilograms.</p>

<p>It used four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) powered by plutonium-238. The spacecraft needed 100 Watts to power all the equipment. At launch, it provided a combined 155 W, and 140 W while in transit to Jupiter. By 2001, it became 65W leading to operation of only selected instruments.</p>

<p>Mission computation was largely performed on Earth with the commands transmitted to the spacecraft. It had a meagre capacity of 6,144 bytes, a limited form of a processor, two command decoders and one distributor which required ground control to prepare commands in advance.</p>

<h3 id="plaque">Plaque:</h3>
<p>Pioneer 10 contains a gold plaque which provides information about the origin of the spacecraft. Designed by Dr Carl Sagan and Dr Frank Drake, it was drawn by Linda Salzman Sagan. The plaque consists of diagrams of a man and a woman, completely nude. It also has the diagram showing the position of our solar system in the galaxy and the chemical information about hydrogen.</p>

<h3 id="scientific-instruments">Scientific Instruments:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Infrared Radiometer - Evaluated heat output and cloud temperature from Jupiter</li>
  <li>Quadri-spherical Plasma Analyzer - Detect particles of solar wind</li>
  <li>Cosmic Ray Telescope (CRT) - Collect data on the composition and energy ranges of cosmic rays</li>
  <li>Helium Vector Magnetometer (HVM) - Measured the interplanetary magnetic field, solar wind interaction with Jupiter’s magnetic field, and Jovian magnetic field.</li>
  <li>Geiger Tube Telescope (GTT) - Survey the electrons and protons present in the radiation belts of Jupiter along the spacecraft’s path.</li>
  <li>Trapped Radiation Detector (TRD) - To detect light emitted by particles</li>
  <li>Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) - Build visual images of the planet by looking at it through red and blue lights.</li>
  <li>Meteoroid Detectors</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: NASA was established in 1958 as opposed to 1959 as mentioned by Shankar.</em></p>

<p>Pioneer 10 (Pioneer F) was the first aircraft to give humans an insight into the planet Jupiter and its moons. It was the first mission to Jupiter. It was part of the Pioneer program, a series of United States unmanned space missions launched between 1958 and 1978.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives:</h3>
<p>Document Jupiter, its environment and its moon (mainly Europa, Callisto, Io, Ganymede) through photographs (Jovian System)
Study the solar wind, cosmic rays, heliosphere, and far reaches of the Solar System
Explore the atmosphere and radioactivity of the planet
Study the outer Solar System and heliosphere exploration
Study the asteroid belt</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Gary Flandro, an aerospace engineer, conceived a mission to exploit a rare outer planets’ alignment.
The space probe was manufactured by TRW Inc. They were given a combined $380 million contract in 1970 to build Pioneer 10 and 11.
It took 25 million man-hours
As per a TRW engineer, “This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.”</p>

<h3 id="spacecraft-and-design">Spacecraft and Design:</h3>
<p>Six 76-centimetres long panels attached to a 36-centimetres bus to form a hexagonal structure. It could host eight to eleven instruments which were protected in a honeycomb aluminium structure. The orientation of the probe was controlled by the use of propellant (conical scanning). Aluminized mylar and kapton blankets (insulation coating) for passive thermal control. It carried 36 kilograms of liquid hydrazine monopropellant with a total launch mass of 260 kilograms.</p>

<p>It used four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) powered by plutonium-238. The spacecraft needed 100 Watts to power all the equipment. At launch, it provided a combined 155 W, and 140 W while in transit to Jupiter. By 2001, it became 65W leading to operation of only selected instruments.</p>

<p>Mission computation was largely performed on Earth with the commands transmitted to the spacecraft. It had a meagre capacity of 6,144 bytes, a limited form of a processor, two command decoders and one distributor which required ground control to prepare commands in advance.</p>

<h3 id="plaque">Plaque:</h3>
<p>Pioneer 10 contains a gold plaque which provides information about the origin of the spacecraft. Designed by Dr Carl Sagan and Dr Frank Drake, it was drawn by Linda Salzman Sagan. The plaque consists of diagrams of a man and a woman, completely nude. It also has the diagram showing the position of our solar system in the galaxy and the chemical information about hydrogen.</p>

<h3 id="scientific-instruments">Scientific Instruments:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Infrared Radiometer - Evaluated heat output and cloud temperature from Jupiter</li>
  <li>Quadri-spherical Plasma Analyzer - Detect particles of solar wind</li>
  <li>Cosmic Ray Telescope (CRT) - Collect data on the composition and energy ranges of cosmic rays</li>
  <li>Helium Vector Magnetometer (HVM) - Measured the interplanetary magnetic field, solar wind interaction with Jupiter’s magnetic field, and Jovian magnetic field.</li>
  <li>Geiger Tube Telescope (GTT) - Survey the electrons and protons present in the radiation belts of Jupiter along the spacecraft’s path.</li>
  <li>Trapped Radiation Detector (TRD) - To detect light emitted by particles</li>
  <li>Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) - Build visual images of the planet by looking at it through red and blue lights.</li>
  <li>Meteoroid Detectors</li>
  <li>Charged Particle Instrument (CPI) - Detect cosmic rays</li>
  <li>Asteroid/Meteoroid Detector (AMD)</li>
  <li>Ultraviolet Photometer - Determine the quantity of hydrogen and helium in space and the atmosphere of Jupiter.</li>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Birth control is a method or a device that is used to prevent pregnancy. Though safe and effective birth control came into existence only in the 20th century, ways to prevent pregnancy have been devised since ancient times. Birth control has been the centre of many controversies as well.</p>

<p>For pregnancy to occur, sperm must flow up the vagina, through the cervical opening into uterus into one of the fallopian tubes. If an egg is present in the tube, one sperm could fertilise it. Contraceptives either block the sperm kills it before it reaches uterus or prevents ovulation.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-birth-control">History of birth control</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cave paintings from 15,000 years ago in France apparently depicted condoms.</li>
  <li><strong>Ebers Papyrus</strong>, an Egyptian medical papyrus from around 1550 BC and <strong>Kahun Papyrus</strong> from 1850 BC have documented some form of birth control from the ancient Egyptian times. These used honey, acacia leaves etc to be placed in the vagina to block sperm.</li>
  <li>Chinese used Mercury and Lead cocktail that lead to sterility, brain damage, kidney failure and death.</li>
  <li>Things like acacia gums were used to be placed inside the vagina. Acacia has spermatocide properties.</li>
  <li>Other ways were to cover the vagina using gummy substances, sodium carbonate and a mixture made of crocodile dung.</li>
  <li>Less effective <strong>coitus interruptus</strong> (withdrawal) was also practiced.</li>
  <li>Greek physician <strong>Soranus</strong> advised women to hold their breath and sneeze after the intercourse in 200 A.D.</li>
  <li>Botanist <strong>Theophrastus</strong> mentioned the use of <strong>Siphilium</strong>, a plant that could induce abortion and had contraceptive abilities. It grew scarcely near the city of Cyrene (Libya) and it’s scarcity made it valuable more than it’s weight in Silver in 1<sup>st</sup> century B.C.</li>
  <li>Indians used a combination of rock salt, honey and elephant dung.</li>
  <li>Olive oil and cedar oil combinations were used in Greece.</li>
  <li>Steaming technique using hot stones and medicated solutions were used to kill sperms. Later a modification using a pipe to push steam into vagina was used in medieval Europe, which often resulted in burns.</li>
  <li>An Indian tradition of sitting on a steaming pot of onion and water was used by Jewish women in Manhattan.</li>
  <li>Lactation for a longer time was also used as way to prevent pregnancy.</li>
  <li>During middle ages, women believed tying weasel testicles to their thighs would prevent pregnancy.</li>
  <li>Giacomo Casanova used partially squeezed lemon halves as cervical cap. Team of Australian scientists found out that lemon juice could indeed kill sperms.</li>
  <li>Animal intestines condoms were widely used in 1600s and in 1700s, linen was also used. They weren’s throw away stuff.</li>
  <li>In the mid-1800s vulcanised rubber was patented and condoms came into use.</li>
  <li>Anti-obscenity laws prevented women from gaining access to condoms in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup>centuries. Lizol and Coke were used. Diet coke was effective in killing sperm but not fast enough.</li>
  <li>In 1960, oral pills were approved.</li>
  <li>IUDs came in subsequent years.</li>
  <li>In 2016, German carpenter Clemens Bimek patented a device that is implanted into scrotum which has a switch to control ejaculation.</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Obelisks</strong>: An Egyptian invention. Shadows are tracked to calculate the time of day.</li>
  <li><strong>Sundial</strong>: A device that uses shadow cast by sunlight to measure time as the sun moves overhead. Egyptians used these in B.C. 3500. In 1500 B.C. Egyptians built a more accurate sundial which was divided into 10 parts. This one was accurate only half the time and afternoon it had to be rotated by 180°</li>
  <li>Issues:
    <ul>
      <li>Path of sun changes throughout the year.</li>
      <li>Doesn’t work on rainy or overcast days.</li>
      <li>Doesn’t work during the night.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Water Clocks</strong>: Used mostly as time measuring devices.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mechanical-clocks">Mechanical Clocks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First mechanical clocks might have been used in monasteries to keep monks aware of the prayer times.</li>
  <li>Most of these were large weight driven “turret” clocks which stuck at every hour and did not have a face or a hand.</li>
  <li>Salisbury Cathedral in England has the oldest clock which chimes every hour. These type of clocks had errors of up to half an hour a day and weren’t accurate.</li>
  <li>During mid of the 1400s, German and Italian clockmakers started making clocks that made use of wound spring. Most of these had only hour hands and the minute hand came into existence only during the 1650s.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pendulums">Pendulums</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Master inventor Galileo devised the timekeeping property of pendulum and in 1656, Christiaan Huygens started using the pendulum as a time controller in clocks.</li>
  <li>The time period of a pendulum was independent of the mass of the pendulum and to the extent of the swing, but depended only on the length of the pendulum. A pendulum of around 99 cm (39 inches) has a time period of around 1 sec. Even an increase in length by 0.025 mm would make a difference of 1 sec in a day. Which means a steel pendulum can lose up to a second a day with a temperature variation of 2.2°C. A special alloy called “Invar” which has a small co-efficient of expansion is sometimes used to make pendulums.</li>
  <li>A series of clocks which were weight driven and had pendulums were devised and built. Due to their weight they were not suitable for hanging from the wall, instead, the casing was extended towards the ground and this led to the creation of “Grandfather” clocks.</li>
  <li>In 1670 the seconds pendulum was added to the clock which oscillated once every second.</li>
  <li>An escape wheel is used which is allowed to rotate one tooth per double swing of the pendulum and also transmits the impulse to the pendulum.</li>
  <li>Escapement has two main functions: transmit the impulse without hampering the free swing and to transmit a uniform impulse.</li>
  <li>Edmund Beckett invented a gravity clock using double three-legged gravity escapement and used this for Westminster which we adorably call <strong>The Big Ben</strong> :wink:.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-components">The Components</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Escapement</strong>: Escapement is used to transfer the gravitational force acting on the weights to the clock’s mechanism. In this mechanism, a weight unwinds a rope from a barrel which turns the toothed escape wheel. A vertical rod with pellets at each end called a verge is used. When the weight drops and the wheel rotates, the top pallet arrests the wheel resulting in oscillation on the regulating weights. This oscillation turns the verge and that releases the wheel from the pellet until it is caught by the second pellet on the other side of the verge. This process is repeated. This action produces the “tick-tock”.</li>
  <li><strong>The wheelwork</strong>: This mechanism, also called the <em>train</em> is responsible for transmitting the motion from the weight or spring mechanism to the hands of the clock through a series of wheels and pinions precisely calibrated to ensure steady transmission of power. There is a gearing mechanism that drives the clock and uses a 12:1 gearing ratio to move the hour hand.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="electric-clocks">Electric Clocks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First made in 1840, the first electric clock had a pendulum and spring mechanism and used an electrical impulse to operate a number of dials.</li>
  <li>The first complete electric clock was invented in 1906.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="quart-crystals">Quart crystals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Quartz crystal was first used in clocks in 1929. A big leap in precise timekeeping.</li>
  <li>A ring of quartz of 2.5 mm in diameter is suspended by threads in a heat-resistant chamber. Electrodes are connected to the surface of the ring and the 100,000 hertz frequency of vibration is reduced by a process called <em>frequency division</em> and applied to a synchronous motor.</li>
  <li>6 million to 1 ratio of gearing is used to move the second hand and the precision is of the order of one second every 10 years.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="watches">Watches</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Watches came into use around the 1500s. Peter Henlein, a locksmith from Germany made early models of watches using verge as the escapement method.</li>
  <li>Germany and France produced early watches which were not wrist watches but were worn on chains around the neck.</li>
  <li>These early watches had no minute or second hands and had only hour hands.</li>
  <li>Early watches used wound up springs, which were coil springs that could be wound up to store energy. This energy is then transferred using wheel train and escapement.</li>
  <li>The major drawback was the change in torque as the spring unwinds. This was countered by use of <em>fusee</em>, a cone-shaped, grooved pulley system that kept the torque constant by the variable diameter of the cone.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="navigation-and-need-for-precision">Navigation and need for precision</h2>
<p>Navigators needed to have accurate ways of determining the time to also determine their location.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Latitude could be calculated based on the position of sun’s angle at noon.</li>
  <li>Time at a reference point was necessary to identify the longitude. At equator 15° change in latitude is equivalent to an hours difference in time.</li>
  <li>Pendulums do not work well at sea.</li>
  <li>In 1714, the Engish government promised a reward of £20,000 to anyone who can measure longitude to the accuracy of 0.5° which corresponds to an error of 35 miles at the equator and an accuracy of 3 s/day.</li>
  <li>The prize was won by John Harrison who made the sea going H4 clocks with the accuracy of 0.2 s/day with the error of only 30 km on a 7-day trip.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="greenwich-mean-time">Greenwich Mean Time</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Set as a standard in 1884.</li>
  <li>Since the path of the sun varies, there was a deviation of +/- 15 mins. Hence mean annual average of motion of sun was considered.</li>
  <li>1 second = 1/864,000 of a mean day.</li>
  <li>Issues:
    <ul>
      <li>Variation in earth’s rotation.</li>
      <li>Weather</li>
      <li>Tides</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Replaced by UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) which is pretty much similar to GMT and is maintained by an ensemble of around 260 clocks maintained in 40 countries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="atomic-clocks">Atomic clocks</h3>
<p>Atomic clocks were a major breakthrough in the development of highly accurate clocks for use in various scientific devices and in modern exploration including space.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1955: Cesium atomic clock was invented by Essen and Parry at National Physical Laboratory.</li>
  <li>More clocks were reproduced in the following years and Caesium clocks were adopted as the basis for time measurement.</li>
  <li>Present day atomic clocks have an accuracy of 1 sec in 3 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="working-of-atomic-clock">Working of atomic clock</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Uses quantum mechanical states of energy and precise energy levels of electrons.</li>
  <li>The frequency at which Cesium releases peak energy is calculated and time is calculated accordingly.</li>
  <li>High precision. Used in space technology where nanosecond level of precision is required.</li>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h2 id="world-runs-on-coffee">World runs on coffee</h2>
<p>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages on the planet alongside water and tea. It is the second most traded commodity after oil. Coffee has also given rise to a culture of coffee shops or coffee houses which seems to be a recent phenomenon. But are they really a thing of 21<sup>st</sup> century or do they have some history? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3 id="beverage-of-choice">Beverage of choice</h3>
<p>Coffee is a magical drink of choice. Its ever-increasing popularity can be attributed to its versatility and of course <strong>Caffeine</strong> the magic alkaloid that gives you bliss as you sip your coffee down.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The coffee plant originated in Africa</li>
  <li>Two different variety of Coffee:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arabica</strong>: The more popular and expensive variety, this is considered to be milder and more flavourful. The bean is flatter and elongated and requires a cool sub-tropical climate.  Typically grows around the elevation ranging from 2000 - 6500 ft where it needs sun, moisture and shade. Largest producers of Arabica are <strong>Latin America</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong>, <strong>Arabia</strong> and <strong>East Africa</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Robusta</strong>: This is cheaper to produce but has almost twice the quantity of caffeine than the <strong>Arabica</strong> coffee. Robusta beans are rounder and can grow at lower altitudes (sea level - 2000 ft.). <strong>Central and Western Africa</strong>, <strong>South East Asia</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong> are the leading producers of Robusta.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history-of-coffee">History of Coffee</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Coffee plants grew in the wild in the area called Kefa or Kaffa in Ethiopia. These plants were taken to Arabia and cultivated around the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li>Legend is attributed to a goatherd by the name <strong>Kaldi</strong> who noticed that his heard started behaving weirdly after eating certain berries. He tasted them and felt ecstatic as well. He made coffee popular according to the legend.</li>
  <li>Since it was an intoxicating drink, Islam forbade drinking coffee since such drinks are prohibited by Quran.</li>
  <li>Despite the risk, coffee lovers grew in leaps and bounds within Arabia and drink became popular.</li>
  <li>This paved way for the creation of “Coffeehouses” called <strong>Qahveh Khanehs</strong> and gave rise to the coffee house culture. They first appeared in Mecca around the 15<sup>th</sup> century and were popular places to catch up with friends.</li>
  <li>Coffee came to Europe around 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries and spread across Europe.</li>
  <li>Some countries prohibited coffee stating they are magical potions.</li>
  <li>Coffee houses became popular in Britain and British colonies by 17<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li><strong>Yemen</strong> was almost the only supplier of coffee until the close of 17<sup>th</sup> century. But the popularity of the beverage took it all the way to <strong>Java</strong> in Indonesia and Americas along with Hawaii (since 1825).</li>
  <li>By 20th century Brazil became a leading producer and exporter of Coffee.</li>
  <li>In 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, coffee machines came into existence and various new methods of producing coffee came into being.</li>
  <li>Instant coffee came into popularity and production was perfected post-1950 leading to the increased production of Robusta.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="caffeine---the-magical-ingredient">Caffeine - the magical ingredient</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Caffeine is an alkaloid which is present in coffee, tea, cocoa and in some other nuts and berries.</li>
  <li>It normally is a white powder highly soluble in hot water.</li>
  <li>Caffeine stimulates central nervous system, heart and kidneys. It is also a mild diuretic (removes urine).</li>
  <li>Used as an antidote to respiratory depression caused by overdose.</li>
  <li>Negative effects: Insomnia, anxiety, irritation etc.</li>
  <li>Positive effects: Increased alertness and improved motor performance.</li>
  <li>Decaffeinated coffee became popular to control the amount of coffee in the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="production-of-coffee">Production of coffee</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee cherries contain coffee beans, usually two. Single beaned berries are called <strong>pea beans</strong> and are said to be sweeter and flavourful.</li>
  <li>Beans are separated from the berries and the dried to reduce the moisture content from 65-70% down to 12-13%.</li>
  <li>Three techniques are used for processing coffee:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dry method</strong>: In this process, the berries are placed under the sun on concrete or brick patios. This is the simplest way of processing and is least expensive. Practised in areas with dry and warm climate like Ethiopia and Brazil. The berries are raked to move them around and to prevent fermentation. The process takes few days to around four weeks. Overdrying breaks the coffee and underlying causes fungi and other bacteria attack. Once dried, the coffee beans are separated by machinery.</li>
      <li><strong>Wet method</strong>: This method produces better quality coffee and requires much more sophisticated equipment than the dry method. The skin and the pulp are removed using a pulping machine that uses a rotating drum. The thin layer of pulp that still remains is removed by fermentation that happens over three days as the wet seeds are kept in tanks. Remaining pulp is washed off and the beans are dried under the sun or by passing hot air.</li>
      <li><strong>Pulped natural process</strong>: In this third way of processing, the pulp is removed mechanically but there is no intermediate fermentation and the remaining pulp is removed once the beans dry off. This is a combination of dry and wet techniques. The beans produced in this method are both sweet and acidic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Post the processing the coffee is graded and stored.</p>

<h3 id="roasting-and-grinding">Roasting and Grinding</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee beans are roasted between 180-250 °C from 7-20 mins releasing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water.</li>
  <li>The beans lose weight and expand under the roasting process.</li>
  <li>Roasting gives the aroma to the coffee.</li>
  <li>Overroasting kills the flavour which is done in the case of Robusta beans to remove the strong coffee flavour.</li>
  <li>The old method was to roast coffee beans in a rotating metal cylinder above a source of heat. Modern method uses hot air to roast the beans. Rotation ensures even roasting.</li>
  <li>Grinding is either done before packaging or done by the consumer depending on the brew method involved. We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" target="_blank">French Press</a>, hence coarsely ground coffee is what purchase.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="packaging-and-brewing">Packaging and Brewing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee needs to be sealed airtight to prevent moisture from reaching it.</li>
  <li>Modern methods use inert gas and aluminium or polyethene compounds.</li>
  <li>Different methods of brewing:
    <ul>
      <li>French Press</li>
      <li>Pour over</li>
      <li>Moka Pot</li>
      <li>Aeropress</li>
      <li>Cold brewing</li>
      <li>Espresso</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instant coffee is a soluble coffee concentrate which does not need to be brewed but the flavour is usually inferior to brewed coffee.</li>
  <li>Kopi Luwak (Civet coffee).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="decaf">Decaf</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For people who do not tolerate caffeine, it is removed from the coffee using chemical solvents, carbon filtering or carbon dioxide extraction. Caffeine is extracted just before roasting.</li>
  <li>The chemical agent is either used to treat the beans directly or the water-based solution in which the beans are soaked.</li>
  <li>Swiss water process is used to get more flavourful beans. The first batch of beans are processed in hot water and that water is used for washing the next bath of the beans.</li>
  <li>100% decaf is not a possibility.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="world-runs-on-coffee">World runs on coffee</h2>
<p>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages on the planet alongside water and tea. It is the second most traded commodity after oil. Coffee has also given rise to a culture of coffee shops or coffee houses which seems to be a recent phenomenon. But are they really a thing of 21<sup>st</sup> century or do they have some history? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3 id="beverage-of-choice">Beverage of choice</h3>
<p>Coffee is a magical drink of choice. Its ever-increasing popularity can be attributed to its versatility and of course <strong>Caffeine</strong> the magic alkaloid that gives you bliss as you sip your coffee down.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The coffee plant originated in Africa</li>
  <li>Two different variety of Coffee:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arabica</strong>: The more popular and expensive variety, this is considered to be milder and more flavourful. The bean is flatter and elongated and requires a cool sub-tropical climate.  Typically grows around the elevation ranging from 2000 - 6500 ft where it needs sun, moisture and shade. Largest producers of Arabica are <strong>Latin America</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong>, <strong>Arabia</strong> and <strong>East Africa</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Robusta</strong>: This is cheaper to produce but has almost twice the quantity of caffeine than the <strong>Arabica</strong> coffee. Robusta beans are rounder and can grow at lower altitudes (sea level - 2000 ft.). <strong>Central and Western Africa</strong>, <strong>South East Asia</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong> are the leading producers of Robusta.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history-of-coffee">History of Coffee</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Coffee plants grew in the wild in the area called Kefa or Kaffa in Ethiopia. These plants were taken to Arabia and cultivated around the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li>Legend is attributed to a goatherd by the name <strong>Kaldi</strong> who noticed that his heard started behaving weirdly after eating certain berries. He tasted them and felt ecstatic as well. He made coffee popular according to the legend.</li>
  <li>Since it was an intoxicating drink, Islam forbade drinking coffee since such drinks are prohibited by Quran.</li>
  <li>Despite the risk, coffee lovers grew in leaps and bounds within Arabia and drink became popular.</li>
  <li>This paved way for the creation of “Coffeehouses” called <strong>Qahveh Khanehs</strong> and gave rise to the coffee house culture. They first appeared in Mecca around the 15<sup>th</sup> century and were popular places to catch up with friends.</li>
  <li>Coffee came to Europe around 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries and spread across Europe.</li>
  <li>Some countries prohibited coffee stating they are magical potions.</li>
  <li>Coffee houses became popular in Britain and British colonies by 17<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li><strong>Yemen</strong> was almost the only supplier of coffee until the close of 17<sup>th</sup> century. But the popularity of the beverage took it all the way to <strong>Java</strong> in Indonesia and Americas along with Hawaii (since 1825).</li>
  <li>By 20th century Brazil became a leading producer and exporter of Coffee.</li>
  <li>In 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, coffee machines came into existence and various new methods of producing coffee came into being.</li>
  <li>Instant coffee came into popularity and production was perfected post-1950 leading to the increased production of Robusta.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="caffeine---the-magical-ingredient">Caffeine - the magical ingredient</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Caffeine is an alkaloid which is present in coffee, tea, cocoa and in some other nuts and berries.</li>
  <li>It normally is a white powder highly soluble in hot water.</li>
  <li>Caffeine stimulates central nervous system, heart and kidneys. It is also a mild diuretic (removes urine).</li>
  <li>Used as an antidote to respiratory depression caused by overdose.</li>
  <li>Negative effects: Insomnia, anxiety, irritation etc.</li>
  <li>Positive effects: Increased alertness and improved motor performance.</li>
  <li>Decaffeinated coffee became popular to control the amount of coffee in the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="production-of-coffee">Production of coffee</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee cherries contain coffee beans, usually two. Single beaned berries are called <strong>pea beans</strong> and are said to be sweeter and flavourful.</li>
  <li>Beans are separated from the berries and the dried to reduce the moisture content from 65-70% down to 12-13%.</li>
  <li>Three techniques are used for processing coffee:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dry method</strong>: In this process, the berries are placed under the sun on concrete or brick patios. This is the simplest way of processing and is least expensive. Practised in areas with dry and warm climate like Ethiopia and Brazil. The berries are raked to move them around and to prevent fermentation. The process takes few days to around four weeks. Overdrying breaks the coffee and underlying causes fungi and other bacteria attack. Once dried, the coffee beans are separated by machinery.</li>
      <li><strong>Wet method</strong>: This method produces better quality coffee and requires much more sophisticated equipment than the dry method. The skin and the pulp are removed using a pulping machine that uses a rotating drum. The thin layer of pulp that still remains is removed by fermentation that happens over three days as the wet seeds are kept in tanks. Remaining pulp is washed off and the beans are dried under the sun or by passing hot air.</li>
      <li><strong>Pulped natural process</strong>: In this third way of processing, the pulp is removed mechanically but there is no intermediate fermentation and the remaining pulp is removed once the beans dry off. This is a combination of dry and wet techniques. The beans produced in this method are both sweet and acidic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Post the processing the coffee is graded and stored.</p>

<h3 id="roasting-and-grinding">Roasting and Grinding</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee beans are roasted between 180-250 °C from 7-20 mins releasing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water.</li>
  <li>The beans lose weight and expand under the roasting process.</li>
  <li>Roasting gives the aroma to the coffee.</li>
  <li>Overroasting kills the flavour which is done in the case of Robusta beans to remove the strong coffee flavour.</li>
  <li>The old method was to roast coffee beans in a rotating metal cylinder above a source of heat. Modern method uses hot air to roast the beans. Rotation ensures even roasting.</li>
  <li>Grinding is either done before packaging or done by the consumer depending on the brew method involved. We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" target="_blank">French Press</a>, hence coarsely ground coffee is what purchase.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="packaging-and-brewing">Packaging and Brewing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee needs to be sealed airtight to prevent moisture from reaching it.</li>
  <li>Modern methods use inert gas and aluminium or polyethene compounds.</li>
  <li>Different methods of brewing:
    <ul>
      <li>French Press</li>
      <li>Pour over</li>
      <li>Moka Pot</li>
      <li>Aeropress</li>
      <li>Cold brewing</li>
      <li>Espresso</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instant coffee is a soluble coffee concentrate which does not need to be brewed but the flavour is usually inferior to brewed coffee.</li>
  <li>Kopi Luwak (Civet coffee).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="decaf">Decaf</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For people who do not tolerate caffeine, it is removed from the coffee using chemical solvents, carbon filtering or carbon dioxide extraction. Caffeine is extracted just before roasting.</li>
  <li>The chemical agent is either used to treat the beans directly or the water-based solution in which the beans are soaked.</li>
  <li>Swiss water process is used to get more flavourful beans. The first batch of beans are processed in hot water and that water is used for washing the next bath of the beans.</li>
  <li>100% decaf is not a possibility.</li>
</ul>

				<itunes:subtitle>In this episode, we talk about continental drift</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h1 id="continental-drift">Continental Drift</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The idea first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596 and also by Francis Bacon in 1620 mostly due to the apparent similarities in the outlines of the continents. This was the period when maps were surfacing and gave a clearer view of continents.</li>
  <li>Alfred Wegener further developed it in 1912. Stated the continents are moving away from poles due to the bulge towards the equator. Though these forces exist, they are too weak to push the continental plates.</li>
  <li>Wagner suggested that continents once were together and then they started moving apart.</li>
  <li>Supercontinent was called Pangaea which meant entire Earth during the Permian period around 240 million years ago.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tharp-hezeen-map">Tharp-Hezeen Map</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 1977, Marie Tharp and Bruce Hazeen along with artist Heinrich Berann produced the first World Ocean Floor Panorama.</li>
  <li>Tharp worked out of Lamont Geological Observatory at Columbia University.</li>
  <li>Started using sonar pings to gather data from ocean floor since 1952 to map the ocean floor.</li>
  <li>Discovered the rift valley down the centre of Atlantic Ocean.</li>
  <li>The rift extended for more than 40,000 miles and was a proof for the theory of continental drift, which was unpopular in the US at the time.</li>
  <li>The existence of the rift confirmed in 1959 by Jacques Costeau in New York where he screened a film of the rift valley that he had filmed.</li>
  <li>Tharp’s hand-drawn diagrams encouraged scientists from US, UK, Canada and other nations to write papers on plate tectonics.</li>
  <li>NatGeo didn’t care about a project to bring all the maps together so they sought help from US Naval Research.</li>
  <li>Hazeen died in 1977 and rest of the mapping project was never completed.</li>
  <li>Only 10-15% of the entire ocean has been mapped and Tharp-Hazeen maps are still relevant.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Apparent fit of continents</li>
  <li>Fossil Correlation:
    <ul>
      <li>Mesasaurus: fossils are found only in the easter coast of South America and Western Coast of Africa</li>
      <li>Cynognathus: fossils found across Africa and South America</li>
      <li>Lystrosaurus: fossil across Africa, India and Antartica</li>
      <li>Glossopteris: fossil across all the southern part of continents including South India.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rocks Correlation
    <ul>
      <li>Mountain ranges in the eastern US and Western Europe match up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Paleo Climate data:
    <ul>
      <li>Glacial striations.</li>
      <li>Bituminous coal: Made from compacted plant remains. Forms only in the tropical climate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Could not explain what caused the drift.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plate-tectonics">Plate Tectonics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mid 1900s, built on Wegner’s theory</li>
  <li>The lithosphere is broken up into seven very large continental and ocean-sized plates, six or seven medium-sized regional plates, and several small ones. They move relative to each other.</li>
  <li>Plates float on asthenosphere beneath the Mantle which comes under the crust.</li>
  <li>Continental crust is made of Granite and is thicker and less denser about 2.7 g per cubic cm. Typically upto 40km thick.</li>
  <li>Oceanic crust is thin and dense made of Basalt.</li>
  <li>The crust sits on top of Mantle, very rich in Magnesium and iron bearing silicate minerals.</li>
  <li>Crust and Mantle make up lithosphere. This floats on asthenosphere.</li>
  <li>Asthenosphere moves due to convection.</li>
  <li>Boundary between crust and mantle is called Mohorovičić discontinuity or Moho after Andrija Mohorovičić. These are defined by seismic studies.</li>
  <li>Lithosphere includes crust and uppper mantle just below Moho.</li>
  <li>Heat below the surface causes mantle to lose its rigidity around 100km below the surface. This is the begining of Asthenosphere.</li>
  <li>At 2900km mantle gives way to outer core and at 5100km, inner core starts.</li>
  <li>Inner core is further divided into Outer-Inner Core (OIC) and Inner-Inner Core (IIC) distiguished by their North-South and East-West polarity of iron crystals respectively.</li>
  <li>Earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the region where plates meet, called fault lines.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-happens-at-the-plate-boundaries">What happens at the plate boundaries?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Divergent Margins:</strong> Plates moving apart at divergent plate boundary releases pressure which melts the Mantle underneath. Magma created as a result of this moves upwards and cools just below the surface creating new crust. Hence these are also called constructive margins.</li>
  <li><strong>Continental Rifting:</strong> Magma rising up causes  the lithosphere to stretch and lift up. This results in rift on the surface of continents. The rift continues until the crust become thin and a new ocean is formed. The rising magma cools down and since it is basalting, forms the basin for the new ocean.</li>
  <li><strong>Seafloor Spreading:</strong> As magma keeps rising, the sea floor starts to spread. New rocks are created on the ocean floor and hence the age of rocks on the seabed are much less than that found on continents.</li>
  <li><strong>Convegent Margin:</strong> Since Earth has a finite surface area, the creation of new crust is balanced out by destructive plate margins or Convergent Margins where the crust sinks into the mantle. When two plates meet, the older one usually subducts below the younger warmer plate. If the convergence happens between oceanic and continental plates, the continental plate being less denser and hence more bouyant, stays on top and the oceanic plate subducts beneath. This results on continental crusts being preserved and oceanic crust being regenerated every few million years. Hence the fossils of deep sea creatures are sometimes found on the surface of continents. When the collision happens between two continental plates, results in the creation of mountain ranges like the Himalayas which formed when the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate and eliminated the ocean in between.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Subduction Zones:</strong> Subduction happens when lithosphere of around 100km thickness decends into the mantle. This creates earthquake zones along the zone called the <strong>Wadati-Benioff</strong> zone. Places like Japan lie on these zones and are prone to earthquakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Transform boundary: plates slide against one another. Earthquakes happen here. San Andreas fault in California.</li>
  <li>Convergent boundaries: Plates collide.
    <ul>
      <li>Subduction zone: Continental crust collides with oceanic crust resulting in the sinking of oceaning crust beneath continental crust da ue to the higher density of oceanic crust and results in melting of the crust and forms active volcanoes. This results in earthquakes, volcanoes and deep trenches. Andes mountains.</li>
      <li>Island Arc: Oceanic crust with Oceanic crust. One of the crust sinks, normally the older rock. Results in volcanoes, trenches.</li>
      <li>Collision zone: Continental to continentalThe The . Himalayas.
  The - Island of Cyprus formed athe t boundary of African and Eurasian plates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Divergent boundaries: Plates move away from each other.
    <ul>
      <li>On land:  Rift zone, rock is ripped apart and normally found in the ocean and particularly in East Africa. Active volcanoes and minor earthquakes.</li>
      <li>Mid ocean: Creates alternating bands of magnetism because of change in Earth’s magentism which is a proof for divergance. Mid Atlantic ridge is an example.</li>
      <li>Iceland is geologically active mainly due to being on the divergent plates.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="continental-drift">Continental Drift</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The idea first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596 and also by Francis Bacon in 1620 mostly due to the apparent similarities in the outlines of the continents. This was the period when maps were surfacing and gave a clearer view of continents.</li>
  <li>Alfred Wegener further developed it in 1912. Stated the continents are moving away from poles due to the bulge towards the equator. Though these forces exist, they are too weak to push the continental plates.</li>
  <li>Wagner suggested that continents once were together and then they started moving apart.</li>
  <li>Supercontinent was called Pangaea which meant entire Earth during the Permian period around 240 million years ago.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tharp-hezeen-map">Tharp-Hezeen Map</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 1977, Marie Tharp and Bruce Hazeen along with artist Heinrich Berann produced the first World Ocean Floor Panorama.</li>
  <li>Tharp worked out of Lamont Geological Observatory at Columbia University.</li>
  <li>Started using sonar pings to gather data from ocean floor since 1952 to map the ocean floor.</li>
  <li>Discovered the rift valley down the centre of Atlantic Ocean.</li>
  <li>The rift extended for more than 40,000 miles and was a proof for the theory of continental drift, which was unpopular in the US at the time.</li>
  <li>The existence of the rift confirmed in 1959 by Jacques Costeau in New York where he screened a film of the rift valley that he had filmed.</li>
  <li>Tharp’s hand-drawn diagrams encouraged scientists from US, UK, Canada and other nations to write papers on plate tectonics.</li>
  <li>NatGeo didn’t care about a project to bring all the maps together so they sought help from US Naval Research.</li>
  <li>Hazeen died in 1977 and rest of the mapping project was never completed.</li>
  <li>Only 10-15% of the entire ocean has been mapped and Tharp-Hazeen maps are still relevant.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Mid 1900s, built on Wegner’s theory</li>
  <li>The lithosphere is broken up into seven very large continental and ocean-sized plates, six or seven medium-sized regional plates, and several small ones. They move relative to each other.</li>
  <li>Plates float on asthenosphere beneath the Mantle which comes under the crust.</li>
  <li>Continental crust is made of Granite and is thicker and less denser about 2.7 g per cubic cm. Typically upto 40km thick.</li>
  <li>Oceanic crust is thin and dense made of Basalt.</li>
  <li>The crust sits on top of Mantle, very rich in Magnesium and iron bearing silicate minerals.</li>
  <li>Crust and Mantle make up lithosphere. This floats on asthenosphere.</li>
  <li>Asthenosphere moves due to convection.</li>

<h3 id="timeline-1">Timeline:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>15 June, 1910 - Terra Nova sailed from Cardiff, Wales</li>
  <li>Scott tied up with expedition business, joined Terra Nova in South Africa after catching a faster passenger liner</li>
  <li>Leaves the ship in Melbourne for further business, receives letter from Amundsen</li>
  <li>Rejoined the ship in New Zealand with additional supplies</li>
  <li>Met with heavy storms and loss of supplies in the Sea</li>
  <li>January 1911 - Built a base at Cape Evans (named after Scott’s second-in-command)</li>
  <li>Campbell’s Eastern party to explore King Edward VII Land, meets Amundsen’s party</li>
  <li>January 1911 - Start of Depot laying with the One Ton Depay laid 48 kilometers short of its intended location</li>
  <li>1911 winter - Hut was separated using packing cases for “officers” and “men”</li>
  <li>09 February, 1911 - Campbell’s party became the Northern party and set up camp at Robertson Bay (They could not carry out experiments as per the plan and returned to base came in September 1912)</li>
  <li>Wester Parties - Conducted two geological expeditions</li>
  <li>Journey to Cape Crozier in the winter to secure eggs of emperor penguin and to experiment with food rations and equipment before the polar journey</li>
  <li>13 September, 1911 - South polar journey plans revealed</li>
  <li>24 October, 1911 - The Motor Party left the base</li>
  <li>01 November, 1911 - Scott and his party left the base</li>
  <li>21 November, 1911 - Scott’s party caught up with the Motor party</li>
  <li>03 January, 1912 - Scott chose his party of five (instead of four) - Scott, Wilson, Oates, Bowers and Edgar Evans</li>
  <li>09 January, 1912 - Passed Shackleton’s furthest point</li>
  <li>16 January, 1912 - Saw Amundsen’s black flag</li>
  <li>17 January, 1912 - Reached South Pole (Scott’s entry - “The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected … Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here”)</li>
  <li>18 January, 1912 - Finds Amundsen’s tent, supplies and letter stating they had reached on 16 December, 1911</li>
  <li>Returning homewards - Edgar Evans suffering and Lawrence Oates severe frostbite</li>
  <li>17 February, 1912 - Edgar Evans dies due to head injuries, frostbite and a hand injury which failed to heal</li>
  <li>Reached the meet point, but could not find the dog teams, temperature dropped sharply, and the fuel supplies were meagre</li>
  <li>Low temperature and radiation caused poor surface to pull the sledge, lack of wind made the temperatures even worse, and Oates frostbite reduced the daily average of distance covered to three to five miles down from fifteen</li>
  <li>10 March, 1912 -  It became evident that the dog teams where not coming</li>
  <li>Oates sacrifices himself by walking out of his tent towards his death. Last words, “I am just going outside and may be some time.”</li>
  <li>20 March, 1912 - Reached 11 miles near to the One Ton Depot but a blizzard stopped them in their tracks</li>
  <li>29 March, 1912 - Presumed date of their death and Scott’s last entry - “Every day we have been ready to start for our depot 11 miles away, but outside the door of the tent it remains a scene of whirling drift. I do not think we can hope for any better things now. We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity but I do not think I can write more. R. Scott. Last entry. For God’s sake look after our people.”</li>
  <li>29 October 1912 - Search party sent to find Scott</li>
  <li>12 November 1912 - The tent containing Scott, Wilson, and Bowers found 11 miles south of One Ton Depot</li>
  <li>10 February, 1913 - Edward Atkinson and Lieutenant Harry Pennell reached the ports of New Zealand and relayed a message about the fate of Scott’s party.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scott hailed a tragic hero which overshadowed Amundsen’s achievements</li>
  <li>Critics questioned the leadership abilities of Scott</li>
  <li>The fate of the group said to be the result of many “ifs” with the weather playing the major part</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="timeline-1">Timeline:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>15 June, 1910 - Terra Nova sailed from Cardiff, Wales</li>
  <li>Scott tied up with expedition business, joined Terra Nova in South Africa after catching a faster passenger liner</li>
  <li>Leaves the ship in Melbourne for further business, receives letter from Amundsen</li>
  <li>Rejoined the ship in New Zealand with additional supplies</li>
  <li>Met with heavy storms and loss of supplies in the Sea</li>
  <li>January 1911 - Built a base at Cape Evans (named after Scott’s second-in-command)</li>
  <li>Campbell’s Eastern party to explore King Edward VII Land, meets Amundsen’s party</li>
  <li>January 1911 - Start of Depot laying with the One Ton Depay laid 48 kilometers short of its intended location</li>
  <li>1911 winter - Hut was separated using packing cases for “officers” and “men”</li>
  <li>09 February, 1911 - Campbell’s party became the Northern party and set up camp at Robertson Bay (They could not carry out experiments as per the plan and returned to base came in September 1912)</li>
  <li>Wester Parties - Conducted two geological expeditions</li>
  <li>Journey to Cape Crozier in the winter to secure eggs of emperor penguin and to experiment with food rations and equipment before the polar journey</li>
  <li>13 September, 1911 - South polar journey plans revealed</li>
  <li>24 October, 1911 - The Motor Party left the base</li>
  <li>01 November, 1911 - Scott and his party left the base</li>
  <li>21 November, 1911 - Scott’s party caught up with the Motor party</li>
  <li>03 January, 1912 - Scott chose his party of five (instead of four) - Scott, Wilson, Oates, Bowers and Edgar Evans</li>
  <li>09 January, 1912 - Passed Shackleton’s furthest point</li>
  <li>16 January, 1912 - Saw Amundsen’s black flag</li>
  <li>17 January, 1912 - Reached South Pole (Scott’s entry - “The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected … Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here”)</li>
  <li>18 January, 1912 - Finds Amundsen’s tent, supplies and letter stating they had reached on 16 December, 1911</li>
  <li>Returning homewards - Edgar Evans suffering and Lawrence Oates severe frostbite</li>
  <li>17 February, 1912 - Edgar Evans dies due to head injuries, frostbite and a hand injury which failed to heal</li>
  <li>Reached the meet point, but could not find the dog teams, temperature dropped sharply, and the fuel supplies were meagre</li>
  <li>Low temperature and radiation caused poor surface to pull the sledge, lack of wind made the temperatures even worse, and Oates frostbite reduced the daily average of distance covered to three to five miles down from fifteen</li>
  <li>10 March, 1912 -  It became evident that the dog teams where not coming</li>
  <li>Oates sacrifices himself by walking out of his tent towards his death. Last words, “I am just going outside and may be some time.”</li>
  <li>20 March, 1912 - Reached 11 miles near to the One Ton Depot but a blizzard stopped them in their tracks</li>
  <li>29 March, 1912 - Presumed date of their death and Scott’s last entry - “Every day we have been ready to start for our depot 11 miles away, but outside the door of the tent it remains a scene of whirling drift. I do not think we can hope for any better things now. We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity but I do not think I can write more. R. Scott. Last entry. For God’s sake look after our people.”</li>
  <li>29 October 1912 - Search party sent to find Scott</li>
  <li>12 November 1912 - The tent containing Scott, Wilson, and Bowers found 11 miles south of One Ton Depot</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scott hailed a tragic hero which overshadowed Amundsen’s achievements</li>
  <li>Critics questioned the leadership abilities of Scott</li>
  <li>The fate of the group said to be the result of many “ifs” with the weather playing the major part</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>According to Hubspot research, one of the most confusing emerging technology.</li>
  <li>Blockchain is a digital method of economic transaction record-keeping – also known as a ledger.</li>
  <li>Security keeps it differentiated from other technologies. Records are kept open within a network but no one can edit or delete.</li>
  <li>It is like a database that can be updated only through solving a complex mathematical problem.</li>
  <li>The chain is linked through <em>hash</em> from the previous block and the chain continues to the hash from the <em>genesis block</em> which happens to be the first block in the entire chain.</li>
  <li>Designed to be resistant to modification especially backdating or other tampering with the timestamps and other details in a financial transaction.</li>
  <li>Latest fad in the tech industry.</li>
  <li>Described back in 1991 to timestamp digital documents.</li>
  <li>Used in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto to create cryptocurrency called <em>Bitcoin</em>.</li>
  <li>Each block contains data, hash of the block and the hash of the previous block.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On 9 Jan, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto announced the release of bitcoin as a peer to peer, completely de-centralised network with no server or central authority.</li>
  <li>The idea was to eliminate any middle-man agents like banks or other agencies in the digital transactions.</li>
  <li>In a centralised network, the server keeps a record of all the transactions and validates them. In a decentralised network, every entity on the network does the job of comparing and then validating the authenticity of the transaction.</li>
  <li>Every peer keeps a list of the transactions to ensure all the future transactions are valid.</li>
  <li>Basically cryptocurrency is an entry in a database which can be changed only under specific conditions. Which is true in case of a bank transaction as well.</li>
  <li>Cryptocurrency usually consists of a network of peers and every peer has a complete history of all transactions ever happened and hence the balance of every account.</li>
  <li>A transaction file is signed by individual private key and published in the network. The authenticity of the transaction is confirmed by miners.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin file size grew to 20GB in 2014 and is currently over 100GB in size.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="miners">Miners:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Miners confirm the legitimacy of the transactions and broadcast that to the network. Once a miner confirms, the transaction gets added to the blockchain in all the peers.</li>
  <li>Miners get paid back in the cryptocurrency for this. In case of Bitcoin, the miners earn a specific amount of Bitcoin for validating a transaction.</li>
  <li>To be a miner, some amount of computing power has to be invested into finding the hash to connect the block to the chain.</li>
  <li>Miners compete to solve a series of cryptographic puzzles and as a reward, they are allowed to add a transaction to the coinbase which is the valid way of creating bitcoins.</li>
  <li>Bitcoins are created only when miners solve a puzzle. The difficulty of puzzle increases the computing power required to solve the puzzle and this results in only a specific amount of currency being created in a given amount of time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mining">Mining</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin mining requires a computer and a special software. Miners use the computing power of their systems to compete with other miners to solve a series of complex puzzles.</li>
  <li>Every ten minutes, miners try to solve a block that has the latest transaction data in it using cryptographic hash functions.</li>
  <li>Computer warehouses have been set up to create a business out of bitcoin mining.</li>
  <li>There is a minimum difficulty level set for the hash for the miners to solve. If the incoming hash does not qualify for that level of difficulty, an arbitrary string called nonce is added to the hash and the new string is re-hashed to create a new hash and this new hash is compared to see if it conforms to the difficulty level expected. If not, the nonce is changed and the process is repeated until the required difficulty is attained.</li>
  <li>Once required difficulty is attained, block it added to the blockchain and the ledger is updated. The miners are then rewarded using Bitcoins.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-cryptocurrency">Why cryptocurrency:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Irreversible</strong>: Once a transaction is made, it is irreversible by anyone. There is no way you can dispute a transaction and get the money back.</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymous</strong>: Transactions and accounts are not usually connected to real-world entities. Transaction flow can be analysed by not necessarily the identity of the users.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong>: The transactions are almost instantaneous irrespective of the location of the users.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: Since cryptography is extensively used in cryptocurrency, it is secure. Cryptocurrency can be sent only using the owners private key.</li>
  <li><strong>No middle-man</strong>: No permission is required to use cryptocurrency. There is no middle-man. Anyone can send or receive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hash">Hash</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hash is a method of taking an input string and encoding it to and output of fixed length. A hashing algorithm is used for this conversion. In case of Bitcoin, SHA-256 is used for hashing.</li>
  <li>The fixed length of output helps in saving data that might otherwise be of considerable size.</li>
  <li>Hashes remain the same irrespective of the number of times the data is passed through the algorithm.</li>
  <li>Hashes cannot be converted back to its inputs but can be identified by comparing the data after hashing the possible values again.</li>
  <li>Brute forcing becomes virtually impossible due to the sheer number of tries that is required. For a 128 bit hash, it will take anywhere between 1 and 2<sup>128-1</sup> tries. That means an average of 2<sup>127</sup> tries which is a huge number.</li>
  <li>Any change in the input will reflect in the hash.</li>
  <li>Collision resistance determines the chances of two different inputs producing the same hash. MD5’s (128-bit hash) collision resistance was broken after 2<sup>21</sup> hashes and SHA 1 (160-bit hash) was broken after 2<sup>61</sup> hashes. SHA 256 is used by bitcoin and Keccak 256 is produced by Etherium.</li>
  <li>The blockchain is a linked list of data and it’s associated hash pointer which points to the hash of the previous block and hence forming a block.</li>
  <li>So if an intruder changes data, the resulting hash changes drastically and will no longer have its pointer point to the previous block. This way the blockchain remain immutable (unchangeable).</li>

				<itunes:subtitle>We talk about submarines, the coolest way to travel!</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h2 id="submarines">Submarines</h2>
<h3 id="what-a-submarine-is">What a submarine is:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is an underwater vehicle used mostly for military purpose in the current day and age. Civilian uses mostly for science (marine biology)</li>
  <li>Cylindrical in shape with conical edges.</li>
  <li>Bridge structure called <em>Fin</em> in Europe and <em>Sail</em> in America. Houses periscope and stuff.</li>
  <li>Powered by a propeller or pump jet and has fins on the rear to control the level of the submarine. Along with this also uses ballast tanks which are filled with compressed air to ‘surface’ the craft or filled with water to sink it.</li>
  <li>Nuclear and Diesel powered: Diesel powered subs require air for the combustion of Diesel engines while nuclear submarines used nuclear energy. This enabled them to remain submerged for a much longer duration under water. Modern-day submarines can stay submerged for over 6 months.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Development started before WWI but accelerated during the war.</li>
  <li>Leonardo da Vinci had drawings of a submarine but never materialised into a real craft. It was called a ship to sink another ship. He never revealed it public to prevent wars from turning more deadly than they already are.</li>
  <li>Seems like Greeks had mastered the craft back in the 1500s during the reign of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. A couple of guys emerged dry from underwater in river <strong>Tagus</strong> near the city of <strong>Toledo</strong> in Spain.</li>
  <li><strong>William Bourne</strong>, an English mathematician, mentioned in his book about an underwater navigation device. <strong>John Napier</strong>, Scottish mathematician also mentioned an invention which stayed underwater with divers and could also be used in warfare.</li>
  <li>The first real submarine that was built was done in 1620 by <strong>Cornelis Drebbel</strong>, a Dutchman who worked for King James I of England. It used oars for propulsion.</li>
  <li>Interest in submarines went up during the 18th century and there were patents coming up for submarines.</li>
  <li>Ballast tank idea was patented in 1747 by <strong>Nathaniel Symons</strong> using leather bags filled with water. There was a mechanism to remove water from the bags and re-surface the craft. <strong>Giovanni Borelli</strong> had proposed a similar design earlier.</li>
  <li>The first use of a submarine in combat was built in 1775 by <strong>David Bushnell</strong> and was called <strong>Turtle</strong>. This was used during the American Revolutionary War for attaching explosives to British Navy vessels anchored in the New York harbour. Although the various attempts at attaching explosives failed, it sparked an interest in using submarines for warfare.</li>
  <li>Propulsion of the <strong>Turtle</strong> was done using hand crank and this meant that the pilot needed to have a great stamina to keep the craft steady. The direction was controlled by a lever that controlled the rudder in the rear of the craft.</li>
  <li>The first non-human powered submarine was Plongeur launched in 1963 invented by the French and used compressed air.</li>
  <li><strong>Narcis Monturiol</strong> launched the first combustion-powered submarine Incitnio II in Barcelona in 1864.</li>
  <li>Submarines became effective with the invention of the torpedo by <strong>Robert Whitehead</strong> in 1866.</li>
  <li>English inventor <strong>George Garrett</strong> and Swedish industrialist <strong>Thorsten Nordenfelt</strong> built the first steam submarine capable of firing torpedoes called the Nordenfelt I and had a range of 240 km.</li>
  <li>Irish inventor <strong>John Philip Holland</strong> built the Holland Type IV submarine in 1896 which was hybrid using internal combustion engine while on the surface and electric engine while submerged. This class submarine was purchased by US Navy and was used in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905 as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="world-war-and-the-progress-made">World war and the progress made</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The development of submarine was accelerated during the world war times where naval warfare was as important as land or air warfare.</li>
  <li>U-boats of Germany proved to be deadly in the war.</li>
  <li>During the beginning of the war, both England and Germany had submarines though British had significantly more submarines than Germany.</li>
  <li>Diesel engined U-boats could have a range of 5000 miles and speed of 15 km/h</li>
  <li>During WWI U boats sank over 5000 ships.</li>
  <li>During WW2, U boats wrecked British shipping routes.</li>
  <li>The US wrecked havoc over capable Japanese Navy.</li>
  <li>Pakistani submarine sank INS Khukri, in turn, India sank Ghazi (loaned from the US) submarine of Pakistan.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workings">Workings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A submarine has a cigar-shaped hull. This shape helps in drastically reducing the water resistance around the body of the sub.</li>
  <li>The sail or the fin might also have a bridge on top which is used for observational purposes.</li>
  <li>Propulsion was carried out by humans in the early type of submarines. Before nuclear power was invented, submarines were powered by combustion engines on the surface and electric engines while being submerged.</li>
  <li>Earlier crafts used petrol and the later ones started using diesel-electric engines for reduced flammability and increased efficiency. This also meant the batteries could be charged by running the submarine on diesel engines for some time.</li>

<h3 id="what-a-submarine-is">What a submarine is:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is an underwater vehicle used mostly for military purpose in the current day and age. Civilian uses mostly for science (marine biology)</li>
  <li>Cylindrical in shape with conical edges.</li>
  <li>Bridge structure called <em>Fin</em> in Europe and <em>Sail</em> in America. Houses periscope and stuff.</li>
  <li>Powered by a propeller or pump jet and has fins on the rear to control the level of the submarine. Along with this also uses ballast tanks which are filled with compressed air to ‘surface’ the craft or filled with water to sink it.</li>
  <li>Nuclear and Diesel powered: Diesel powered subs require air for the combustion of Diesel engines while nuclear submarines used nuclear energy. This enabled them to remain submerged for a much longer duration under water. Modern-day submarines can stay submerged for over 6 months.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Development started before WWI but accelerated during the war.</li>
  <li>Leonardo da Vinci had drawings of a submarine but never materialised into a real craft. It was called a ship to sink another ship. He never revealed it public to prevent wars from turning more deadly than they already are.</li>
  <li>Seems like Greeks had mastered the craft back in the 1500s during the reign of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. A couple of guys emerged dry from underwater in river <strong>Tagus</strong> near the city of <strong>Toledo</strong> in Spain.</li>
  <li><strong>William Bourne</strong>, an English mathematician, mentioned in his book about an underwater navigation device. <strong>John Napier</strong>, Scottish mathematician also mentioned an invention which stayed underwater with divers and could also be used in warfare.</li>
  <li>The first real submarine that was built was done in 1620 by <strong>Cornelis Drebbel</strong>, a Dutchman who worked for King James I of England. It used oars for propulsion.</li>
  <li>Interest in submarines went up during the 18th century and there were patents coming up for submarines.</li>
  <li>Ballast tank idea was patented in 1747 by <strong>Nathaniel Symons</strong> using leather bags filled with water. There was a mechanism to remove water from the bags and re-surface the craft. <strong>Giovanni Borelli</strong> had proposed a similar design earlier.</li>
  <li>The first use of a submarine in combat was built in 1775 by <strong>David Bushnell</strong> and was called <strong>Turtle</strong>. This was used during the American Revolutionary War for attaching explosives to British Navy vessels anchored in the New York harbour. Although the various attempts at attaching explosives failed, it sparked an interest in using submarines for warfare.</li>
  <li>Propulsion of the <strong>Turtle</strong> was done using hand crank and this meant that the pilot needed to have a great stamina to keep the craft steady. The direction was controlled by a lever that controlled the rudder in the rear of the craft.</li>
  <li>The first non-human powered submarine was Plongeur launched in 1963 invented by the French and used compressed air.</li>
  <li><strong>Narcis Monturiol</strong> launched the first combustion-powered submarine Incitnio II in Barcelona in 1864.</li>
  <li>Submarines became effective with the invention of the torpedo by <strong>Robert Whitehead</strong> in 1866.</li>
  <li>English inventor <strong>George Garrett</strong> and Swedish industrialist <strong>Thorsten Nordenfelt</strong> built the first steam submarine capable of firing torpedoes called the Nordenfelt I and had a range of 240 km.</li>
  <li>Irish inventor <strong>John Philip Holland</strong> built the Holland Type IV submarine in 1896 which was hybrid using internal combustion engine while on the surface and electric engine while submerged. This class submarine was purchased by US Navy and was used in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905 as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="world-war-and-the-progress-made">World war and the progress made</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The development of submarine was accelerated during the world war times where naval warfare was as important as land or air warfare.</li>
  <li>U-boats of Germany proved to be deadly in the war.</li>
  <li>During the beginning of the war, both England and Germany had submarines though British had significantly more submarines than Germany.</li>
  <li>Diesel engined U-boats could have a range of 5000 miles and speed of 15 km/h</li>
  <li>During WWI U boats sank over 5000 ships.</li>
  <li>During WW2, U boats wrecked British shipping routes.</li>
  <li>The US wrecked havoc over capable Japanese Navy.</li>
  <li>Pakistani submarine sank INS Khukri, in turn, India sank Ghazi (loaned from the US) submarine of Pakistan.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workings">Workings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A submarine has a cigar-shaped hull. This shape helps in drastically reducing the water resistance around the body of the sub.</li>
  <li>The sail or the fin might also have a bridge on top which is used for observational purposes.</li>
  <li>Propulsion was carried out by humans in the early type of submarines. Before nuclear power was invented, submarines were powered by combustion engines on the surface and electric engines while being submerged.</li>
  <li>Earlier crafts used petrol and the later ones started using diesel-electric engines for reduced flammability and increased efficiency. This also meant the batteries could be charged by running the submarine on diesel engines for some time.</li>
  <li>Germans tried using a snorkel that could supply oxygen to the engines while being at periscope depth but not without problems of visible exhaust and speed constraints to prevent snorkel from breaking off.</li>
  <li>During WWII, submarines designed to carry hydrogen peroxide as oxidisers were built by Germany. Due to limited success, these later carried large batteries instead.</li>
  <li>Nuclear energy powers larger submarines in the present day. Nuclear power is used to drive turbines that power the propeller. A disadvantage is the noise generated by coolant pumps whereas a diesel-electric can run on batteries almost quietly.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Gary Ridgway is said to have killed 71 women during the span of 1982-1998.</li>
  <li>Most of the murders took place between 1982-84 and he is said to have killed many that he lost count.</li>
  <li>The bodies were dumped in the Green River, giving him the name The Green River Killer.</li>
  <li>He would also visit the corpse later to have sex with it.</li>
  <li>He contaminated the body with gum, cigarettes, and other materials to throw off the police.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-green-river-task-force">The Green River Task Force</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A task force of 25 full-time detectives was set up to investigate the murders.</li>
  <li>The team included Dave Reichert, Robert Kepper, and John E. Douglas.</li>
  <li>Ted Bundy, another serial killer, helped in the case to find out the behaviour, psychology, and motivation behind the murders.</li>
  <li>He suggests the possibility of necrophilia and suggests the police to stake out fresh grave to capture the killer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="modus-operandi">Modus Operandi:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ridgway picked up women from Pacific South Highway</li>
  <li>Lured them using his family man personality and the picture of his son</li>
  <li>Took them to secluded areas and strangled them to death</li>
  <li>He used his hand in the beginning but began using ligatures to avoid injuries</li>
  <li>Most of the murders were committed in the woods, his truck or his room</li>

  <li>He underwent a polygraph test and passed in 1984</li>
  <li>His saliva and hair samples were collected in 1987, but the technology back then could not connect him to the murders</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="breakthroughs">Breakthroughs:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The saliva and hair samples came to use when DNA technology in the 2000s helped develop a profile of the killer.</li>
  <li>The DNA profile of Ridgway matched with the evidence found at the crime scenes and victims’.</li>
  <li>The paint traces found in the ligature and clothing of the victim traced back to Kenworth Truck Factory.</li>

<h3 id="the-night-stalker">The Night Stalker</h3>
<p>Richard Ramirez was a serial killer nicknamed <em>The Night Stalker</em> who terrorized LA area in the 1980s. He was convicted and sentenced to death for 13 murders, 11 sexual assaults, 14 burglaries and 5 attempted murders.</p>

<h3 id="in-shankars-words">In Shankar’s words:</h3>

<p>The first time I heard about Richard Ramirez was in 2007. My school library had this book on serial killers which I happened to take home for a week. It detailed the antics of serial killers such as Ted Bundy (of course), BTK, Gary Ridgeway, Jack the Ripper, and more.</p>

<p>The fact that the book got through the censorship of the school escapes me. As a parent, I would not want my kid to read a book as such at the age of 16. But as a kid, though it was gruesome, I kind of enjoyed reading about these people who murdered and raped mercilessly.</p>

<p>I had already read about Ted Bundy, BTK, and most of the other well known serial killers from the Ann Rule article in the Reader’s Digest. So, reading about them in this book just refreshed my memories.</p>

<p>But Ramirez was someone I had never heard about. His story caught my attention. A tall, dark, Hispanic man who went on raping, killing, and stealing from everywhere for the kicks and to feed his addiction. He was convicted for 13 counts of murder, 11 counts of sexual assault, 14 counts of burglary, and 5 counts of attempted murder.</p>

<p>But how did he end up there? What were the reasons which lead him to commit such heinous crimes? Let us dig deep.</p>

<h3 id="modus-operandi">Modus Operandi</h3>
<p>He did not have a particular motive most of the time. He attacked and killed the men first. Sexually assaulted the women and brutally killed them. One motive was to grab hold of valuables to fuel his substance abuse.</p>

<h3 id="family-and-childhood">Family and Childhood</h3>
<p>Born in El Paso, Texas, on 29 February 1960, he was the youngest in the family of five children. He had two brothers with disabilities and a sister. He had a Catholic upbringing attending church and services on a regular basis. His father was a former policeman and was abusive in the way he treated his children.</p>

<p>His mother worked in a factory. She kept breathing in the harmful fumes produced by the factory, day in and day out. This is attributed to her two children being born with disabilities. Richard was born without any disabilities. He used to protect his brothers from bullying in school. He had a good name and was popular among the girls in school.</p>

<h3 id="factors-which-might-have-shaped-his-psychopathic-behaviour">Factors which might have shaped his psychopathic behaviour</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Abusive father who beat him and his brothers up.</li>
  <li>Accidental head injuries during childhood leading to epileptic seizures.</li>
  <li>Cousin Miguel who introduced him the gruesome details of the Vietnam war and the crimes the veterans committed</li>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h2 id="writing-isnt-easy">Writing isn’t easy</h2>
<p>Writing can be a daunting task. It can be extremely time-consuming. Or sometimes it becomes hard to put your ideas on paper. Over the course of our journey as a writers, We have come across various tools which helped us write better. And here, We are going to share some of it with you.</p>

<h4 id="1-grammarly">1. Grammarly</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:11:58">11:58</a>} <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="blank">Grammarly</a> is among one of the best writing tools out there. It checks the spellings and grammar, with the ability to switch from American and British English. It also comes with an extension which you can add to your browser which is quite handy while framing emails or commenting on someones Facebook status. Saves you from the embarrassment of spelling and grammar mistakes. The paid version has a lot more features such as proofreading, plagiarism checker, vocabulary enhancement, and a lot more. But yeah, it costs around $11/month. One of the downside is Grammarly is not available on phones or tablet devices. You need to have a computer or laptop at your disposal to use it.</p>

<h4 id="2-hemmingway-app">2. Hemmingway App</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:12">13:12</a>} If like an Indian, you need things for free, look for another tool called <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="blank">Hemmingway App</a>. It is an app which “makes your writing Bold and Clear.” The thing cool about this tool is that it checks the readability and identifies adverbs, passive voices, simpler alternatives for words, hard and very hard sentences. The whole process of proofreading becomes so much easier.</p>

<h4 id="3-small-seo-tools-plagiarism-checker">3. Small SEO Tools Plagiarism Checker</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:16:02">16:02</a>} As the plagiarism checker comes under the premium plan of Grammarly, we use <a href="https://smallseotools.com/plagiarism-checker/" target="blank">Small SEO Tools Plagiarism Checker</a>. It is as effective as Grammarly and helps you find out anything which is remotely plagiarised. Simple to use and easy to identify.</p>

<h4 id="4-microsoft-onedrive">4. Microsoft OneDrive</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:17:32">17:32</a>} The Microsoft Word helps you transfer and share files by the use of <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="blank">OneDrive</a>. You also get to store these files without wasting any space on my computer. So, when I am working remotely or do not have access to a computer, I use OneDrive to share the files with my clients.
Google Drive is an alternative for you to store important files online. But OneDrive is integrated with Microsoft Word, which make the storage and sharing process a lot easier.</p>

<h4 id="5-celtx">5. Celtx</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:18:37">18:37</a>} <a href="https://www.celtx.com/index.html" target="blank">Celtx</a> is a tool used for script writing. The ease to use, the ability to switch from scene to scene, the transition, writing dialogues, everything becomes so easy with Celtx.</p>

<h4 id="6-pixabay">6. Pixabay</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:20:14">20:14</a>} <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="blank">Pixabay</a> is not so much of a tool, but it is a website where you can source royalty free images. I have been using the images from this website for almost all my blog posts. You can even edit the stock pictures to personalise for your use. You do not need any permission or licensing. Makes life a lot simpler.</p>

<h4 id="7-canva">7. Canva</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:22:26">22:26</a>} Sometimes the stock images sourced from Pixabay or any other royalty free image website might not suit in itself to be a blog post image. This calls for a bit of editing which can be done with <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="blank">Canva</a>. It is one of the best editing tools that can be used online. You get the ability to make Facebook, Instagram, Twitter posts with ease using this handy tool. You will also find stock images on Canva which you can use for free.</p>

<h4 id="8-inkscape">8. Inkscape</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:25:27">25:27</a>} A logo plays an important part in the marketing aspect of any business. <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/release/0.92.2/" target="blank">Inkscape</a> is an amazing and easy to use tool for creating logos and manipulate with the existing pictures and turn them into vectors. It is easy to learn and if you have any plans to get into logo making you should check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEQXp_fcqwPcqrzNtWJ1w9w" target="blank">Nick Saporito’s Inkscape tutorials</a>. He explains it in detail and with complete correctness. Do go check his channel out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="writing-isnt-easy">Writing isn’t easy</h2>
<p>Writing can be a daunting task. It can be extremely time-consuming. Or sometimes it becomes hard to put your ideas on paper. Over the course of our journey as a writers, We have come across various tools which helped us write better. And here, We are going to share some of it with you.</p>

<h4 id="1-grammarly">1. Grammarly</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:11:58">11:58</a>} <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="blank">Grammarly</a> is among one of the best writing tools out there. It checks the spellings and grammar, with the ability to switch from American and British English. It also comes with an extension which you can add to your browser which is quite handy while framing emails or commenting on someones Facebook status. Saves you from the embarrassment of spelling and grammar mistakes. The paid version has a lot more features such as proofreading, plagiarism checker, vocabulary enhancement, and a lot more. But yeah, it costs around $11/month. One of the downside is Grammarly is not available on phones or tablet devices. You need to have a computer or laptop at your disposal to use it.</p>

<h4 id="2-hemmingway-app">2. Hemmingway App</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:12">13:12</a>} If like an Indian, you need things for free, look for another tool called <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="blank">Hemmingway App</a>. It is an app which “makes your writing Bold and Clear.” The thing cool about this tool is that it checks the readability and identifies adverbs, passive voices, simpler alternatives for words, hard and very hard sentences. The whole process of proofreading becomes so much easier.</p>

<h4 id="3-small-seo-tools-plagiarism-checker">3. Small SEO Tools Plagiarism Checker</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:16:02">16:02</a>} As the plagiarism checker comes under the premium plan of Grammarly, we use <a href="https://smallseotools.com/plagiarism-checker/" target="blank">Small SEO Tools Plagiarism Checker</a>. It is as effective as Grammarly and helps you find out anything which is remotely plagiarised. Simple to use and easy to identify.</p>

<h4 id="4-microsoft-onedrive">4. Microsoft OneDrive</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:17:32">17:32</a>} The Microsoft Word helps you transfer and share files by the use of <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="blank">OneDrive</a>. You also get to store these files without wasting any space on my computer. So, when I am working remotely or do not have access to a computer, I use OneDrive to share the files with my clients.
Google Drive is an alternative for you to store important files online. But OneDrive is integrated with Microsoft Word, which make the storage and sharing process a lot easier.</p>

<h4 id="5-celtx">5. Celtx</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:18:37">18:37</a>} <a href="https://www.celtx.com/index.html" target="blank">Celtx</a> is a tool used for script writing. The ease to use, the ability to switch from scene to scene, the transition, writing dialogues, everything becomes so easy with Celtx.</p>

<h4 id="6-pixabay">6. Pixabay</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:20:14">20:14</a>} <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="blank">Pixabay</a> is not so much of a tool, but it is a website where you can source royalty free images. I have been using the images from this website for almost all my blog posts. You can even edit the stock pictures to personalise for your use. You do not need any permission or licensing. Makes life a lot simpler.</p>

<h4 id="7-canva">7. Canva</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:22:26">22:26</a>} Sometimes the stock images sourced from Pixabay or any other royalty free image website might not suit in itself to be a blog post image. This calls for a bit of editing which can be done with <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="blank">Canva</a>. It is one of the best editing tools that can be used online. You get the ability to make Facebook, Instagram, Twitter posts with ease using this handy tool. You will also find stock images on Canva which you can use for free.</p>

<h4 id="8-inkscape">8. Inkscape</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:25:27">25:27</a>} A logo plays an important part in the marketing aspect of any business. <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/release/0.92.2/" target="blank">Inkscape</a> is an amazing and easy to use tool for creating logos and manipulate with the existing pictures and turn them into vectors. It is easy to learn and if you have any plans to get into logo making you should check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEQXp_fcqwPcqrzNtWJ1w9w" target="blank">Nick Saporito’s Inkscape tutorials</a>. He explains it in detail and with complete correctness. Do go check his channel out.</p>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-happened-to-our-neanderthal-cousins">What happened to our neanderthal cousins?</h3>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:00:00">00:00</a>} Contrary to popular belief, Columbus did not actually discover America. Almost 500 years before Columbus, Lief Ericsson, a Viking, landed on the coast of Newfoundland. But even he wasn’t the first to reach Americas. Native Americans had already migrated to this region thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:02:50">02:50</a>} We discovered the existence of Neanderthals in 1856 when quarrymen found the fossils of human-like species in the Neander Valley in Germany. In the 1820s, a skull was discovered which belonged to a neanderthal girl. But this discovery did not get much attention.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:04:28">04:28</a>} Neanderthals lived in caves which were intricate in design with many passages and were dark. Everything happened inside these caves, everything! They had a social life where the young took care of the old. After death, the buried the corpse and they were very interested in making jewellery, paintings and carvings.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:32">06:32</a>} The biological characteristics of Neanderthals were different from human beings to adapt to the cold climate of Europe. They had a stockier body with muscle mass and were shorter than modern humans. They had to adapt to the severe cold of the ice age as well. They weren’t as athletic as human beings. Once they settled down in Europe, they did not move around much. They had a larger cranial capacity.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:08:30">08:30</a>} A study of the ear canal of Neanderthals revealed that they were not very agile. The evolutionary changes happened to the Neanderthals when they were settled in Europe. They were comfortable with the conditions in the areas they settled down. There wasn’t much innovation that happened during their time of existence compared to humans who were innovating.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:12:20">12:20</a>} Humans explored more of the world and migrated to different parts of the world and also the population of modern humans were increasing compared to Neanderthals who never exceeded more than 70,000 in number at any given time. Humans were agiler and made advancements in making weapons and tools like the invention of bow and arrow.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:58">13:58</a>} There was a time where modern humans and Neanderthals co-existed. There are different theories on how Neanderthals became extinct. Some speculate that humans killed them off or we interbred into them and slowly all the purebred neanderthals ceased to exist.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:15:42">15:42</a>} Since they were stocky, and lived in dense forests, they used heavy spears and hunted in close proximity. Since they were muscular and strong, they could hunt with spears. The dense forests later retreated back and areas turned into grasslands and this caused a difficulty for them to hunt for prey. They had a higher metabolism rate than humans. This meant they had a bigger requirement for food. There are multiple such reasons that ultimately resulted in their extinction. Diseases might also be a reason for their wipe out. Humans migrating from Africa might have carried diseases which Neanderthals weren’t able to survive.</p>

<p>For now, it remains a mystery as to why such a species ceased to exist.</p>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="podcasting-infrastructure">Podcasting Infrastructure</h3>
<p>We continue our discussion on podcasting and get into the technical aspects of recording and producing a podcast.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:01:00">01:00</a>} Podcasting is huge in North America. But the similar growth isn’t seen in Europe and Asia. This is mostly attributed to the fact that English is the primary language in North America whereas there are a wide variety of languages spoken in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Apart from this, most people in North America use apple devices whereas Android is more popular in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:03:30">03:30</a>} Walkthrough of the podcasting equipment and software used for Writer &amp; Geek Show. We started with a <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Samson-Meteor-Studio-Microphone-Chrome/dp/B004MF39YS" target="blank">Samson Meteor Mic</a>. But this being a condenser mic, we had to record late nights due to the ambient noise that came through.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:00">06:00</a>} We use <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/download/" target="blank">Audacity</a> for our software processing. Audacity is a free software that can very well handle the processing required for podcasting. ALong with Audacity we used <a href="https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm" target="blank">Voicemeeter</a> as a virtual mixer for combining the inputs from two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knox-Gear-Cardioid-USB-Microphone/dp/B012BAX738" target="blank">Knox USB/XLR</a> mics which we use now. We also use a software called Levilator which helps in levelling out the audio volume throughout the episode.</p>

<p>We also purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Yamaha-MG10XU-10-Input-Stereo-Mixer/dp/B00IBIVL42" target="blank">Yamaha MG10XU</a> mixer. This is very versatile entry-level mixer and has helped us drastically improve our audio.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:12:35">12:35</a>} Podcast can be managed using CMS like WordPress but for our podcast, we use Jekyll as the CMS. A custom rss feed is created and submitted to iTunes. For submission, an Apple ID is required and the podcast feed is submitted to iTunes. Once verified, the podcast will be available on iTunes.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:55">13:55</a>} There are many apps for listening podcasts for mobile phones and desktops. Our favourite is Pocket Casts. It has an Android app and a web player. It is lightweight and very user-friendly.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:15:32">15:32</a>} Media file hosting has to be separate from the web hosting. We use Libsyn for media files. there are other services like SoundCloud and Simplecasts etc.</p>

<p>Our podcasting journey started few months back with the launch of Writer &amp; Geek Show. In this episode we discuss on how we started podcasting and how you can start one too. We also talk about the advantages of having a podcast.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:04:15">04:15</a>} Vishnu started listening to podcasts back in 2014 starting with <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/" target="blank">Shop Talk Show</a>. Somewhere in 2015 he started a podcast without having a clue as to what the podcast should be all about. Without any good recording setup, he created episodes using his iPad and hosted the mp3 files on Google Drive.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:08:52">08:52</a>} Interest in podcasts was revived and we decided to start a show. We discuss science, tech and history most of the times, so we decided to put it online for an audience to listen. Motivated to create, we upgraded our podcasting equipment as well. Started with just one USB condenser  microphone. Now we have a complete setup with dynamic mics, mixer, headphones etc.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:00">13:00</a>} Motivation is to have these conversations and learn as we produce episodes. Shankar writes at <a href="http://ramblingjoint.com" target="blank">Rambling Joint</a>. WHich serves as an inspiration for the podcast research and vice versa.</p>

<p>The discussion then moves on to the Writer &amp; Geek Show and how we started it.</p>

<p>Mars One is a mission started by Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno A. Wielders to put humans on Mars starting with a one-way mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:00:48">00:48</a>} SpaceX has revived the interest in space. Since the golden age of space back in the 60s and 70s, there has never been such interest in space as we have now. Thanks to Elon Musk, the private sector is taking over space.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:02:07">02:07</a>} A little skepticism on the Mars One mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:03:42">03:42</a>} Founded by Bas Lansdorp and Arno A. Wielders. The project has two entities - Mars On Foundation and Mars One Ventures. The foundation handles the funding and mission development which includes the recruitment of astronauts. Mars One ventures is the monetization part of Mars One Project.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:05:05">05:05</a>} - Mars One plans to use existing technologies and borrowing hardware from other companies including SpaceX and Lockheed Martin. They believe no scientific breakthrough are needed for the mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:37">06:37</a>} - How are the Astronauts are chosen for the mission? How the application process works? It is a one way mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:08:00">08:00</a>} - Mars One have selected 100 personnel for the mission. It will be cut down to forty first. Then further cut down to twenty-four. The group of twenty-four are divided into four groups of six.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:09:22">09:22</a>} - How many people applied for Mars One. The scam surrounding it. 200,000 estimated applicants, but later found out to be around 2000 to 4000 apllications.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:10:43">10:43</a>} - The group of twenty-four are divided into four groups of six. We can be part of choosing the first group who goes to Mars. Like whaaat??!! Criteria for choosing the astronauts.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:12:29">12:29</a>} - How qualified are the founders to take up such an ambitious project? Do they have prior experience in the field of space travel. How is Elon Musk and SpaceX different from Mars One?</p>

<h3 id="there-were-many">There were many</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:01:30">01:30</a>} There are missions that happened before Apollo 11. All these missions had mission objectives that were testing ground for the Apollo 11.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:02:10">02:10</a>} Apollo 1 was supposed to be the first manned flight of Apollo Spacecraft. But the astronauts <strong>Virgil “Gus” Grissom</strong>, <strong>Edward “Ed” White</strong> and <strong>Roger Chaffee</strong> died in a fire that broke out in the Command Module during a ground testing.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:04:52">04:52</a>} Between Apollo 1 and Apollo 7 which were manned missions, there were a bunch of unmanned missions testing Command Module, Lunar Module and Trans Lunar Ejection.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:08">06:08</a>} Apollo 7: This was the first manned mission after Apollo 1. The mission was mainly designed to test the CSM and long duration flight in Apollo Spacecraft. Due to a head cold, commander Walter M Schirra was irritable throughout the mission and this led to the crew disobeying the mission control.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:11:54">11:54</a>} Apollo 8: First manned mission to leave Earth and orbit another celestial body. During the six day mission, Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders orbited the Moon and were the first humans to see the far side of the Moon. Frank Borman fell sick during this mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:15:16">15:16</a>} Apollo 9: A low earth orbit mission, astronauts spent around 10 days orbiting the earth and tested the LEM in earth’s orbit. LEM was tested by flying out around 100km away from the CSM.</p>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="cheaper-than-a-cab-ride">Cheaper than a cab ride!</h3>
<p>On September 2014, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) achieved what no other space agency has achieved - launching a space probe to Mars and being successful in the first attempt. Mangalyaan was a mission accomplished on a budget of under $74 million, cheaper than the total production cost of the movie Martian.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:00:20">00:20</a>} Yes, you heard it right! It cost less than a movie about Mars. How did India achieve this feat?</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:01:00">01:00</a>} 2014 was a great year for ISRO. On September 24<sup>th</sup> the Prime Minister announced the successful Martian orbital insertion of Mangalyaan. India was the first country to send a space probe to Mars at a low budget as $74 million, less than what it would cost in an auto rickshaw.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:02:55">02:55</a>} The inception of the project happened back in 2008. It took around six years to complete. After the success of the Chandrayaan mission to the Moon, next step was a successful interplanetary probe. It was announced by G Madhavan Nair who was the chairman of ISRO. Indian space agency started in 1969. India launched Aryabhatta, the first satellite in 1975. Ove the years, India developed launch vehicles like PSLV - Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and GSLV - Geo-Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:04:13">04:13</a>} Primary objective of Mangalyaan was to successfully insert the space probe into an orbit around Mars. Mars travel is much more complicated than a moon mission because of the distance. The communication takes time while on a Mars mission. Based on the orientation of the antenna, it could take anywhere between 8 - 45 minutes. The journey took 11 months.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:57">06:57</a>} The secondary objective was to explore Mars using remote sensing technology and to study the moon Phobos of Mars. The Mars orbiter was around the size of an auto rickshaw and weighed around 1337kg. 856kg was propellant. The space agency had to miniaturise the spacecraft to reduce the cost. Powered by three solar panels and a lithium ion battery for backup. The spacecraft was developed in Bangalore.</p>

<h3 id="launch-vehicles">Launch vehicles</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:09:30">09:30</a>} Initially GSLV was planned as a launch vehicle, but due to setbacks in testing, GSLV could not be used due to time constraints. So ISRO had to go back to PSLV, which was used in the launch of Chandrayaan. There is a very narrow launch window to Mars. If the chance is missed, it would be 24 months before another window opens up.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:10:56">10:56</a>} PSLV satellite is used to launch a smaller payload into a low earth polar orbit. Normally used for weather satellites to enable them to be able to scan the earth during a 24 hour period. GSLV is used for heavier payload missions with the capability to put a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, that is, an orbit in which the satellite appears to maintain a relatively fixed position over a point on the surface of the earth. Used for communication satellites. PSLV was less powerful compared to GSLV. ISRO used Hohmann’s transfer methodology to send the spacecraft to Mars.</p>

<h3 id="hohmanns-transfer">Hohmann’s transfer</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:45">13:45</a>} The low earth orbit of the spacecraft is modified into highly elliptical orbit by providing thrust at the perigee point. Multiple such boosts were planned and eventually, the orbit becomes so much elongated that it leaves earth’s sphere of influence and moves into a heliocentric orbit. In the case of Mangalyaan, the path of the spacecraft was calculated in such a way that when it intersects Mars’ orbit, they would meet at the point.</p>

<h3 id="communication-and-other-challenges">Communication and other challenges</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:16:31">16:31</a>} To ensure continuous communication and data transfer from the spacecraft, 32 ground centres were setup around the world. Sriharikota, Port Blair, Indonesia, Brunei and Canberra were few of the locations. Post the launch, communications control moves from Shriharikota to Port Blair, then to Brunei and to Indonesia. After Indonesia till Canberra, there are no land masses to setup a tracking station. So ISRO decided to use two navy vessels to act as ground stations to track the spacecraft.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:19:00">19:00</a>} To contain the mission well within the budget of $74 million, so they used gravity assisted flight to get to Mars using the Hohmann’s transfer method. After the launch, the craft spent around 25 days in earth’s orbit undergoing Hohmann’s transfer. There were some challenges during the 4<sup>th</sup> earth bound manoeuvre, so ISRO had to burn extra fuel during the remaining orbits. Apart from this, due to the high noise ratio of signals back from Mangalyaan, ISRO developed indigenous deep space network antenna.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:22:41">22:41</a>} The engine was not used for around 298 days in the harshness of the space. There was a concern about the engine not starting as the spacecraft neared Mars. Test firing of the engine was done for 3.968 seconds less than two days before entry into Mars orbit.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:24:37">24:37</a>} Since the probe moves to the dark side of Mars, solar panels could not provide any power. The lithium ion batteries provided backup power. Also, all the communications are cut off when the craft moves to the far side of Mars. So pre-instructed commands were given to the spacecraft a day in advance with the list of things to do while on the far side.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:26:04">26:04</a>} India achieved the unique goal of successfully launching a spacecraft to Mars in the first attempt. India also became the fourth country to attempt a launch to Mars. it also became the first country to send a space probe to Mars from Asia and it was the cheapest mission ever to Mars. The lifetime of Mangalyaan was supposed to be six months, but it is still going strong after three years.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:27:05">27:05</a>} The Mangalyaan team also won the <strong>2015 Space Pioneer</strong> award in the category of Science and Engineering which awarded by US based <strong>National Space Society</strong>. Mangalyaan made India a forerunner in the race to Mars.</p>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="earlier-than-you-thought">Earlier than you thought</h3>
<p>3D printing has been a buzz on the internet since past few years, especially in the past 8-10 years. But the process surprisingly was around since 1980s! Surprised? So are we. 3D printing was invented by Chuck Hull in 1983 and he called the process <em>Stereolithography</em>. This was the beginning of <em>Additive Manufacturing</em>. All the traditional methods of manufacturing was a process of removing raw material to create the end product. Additive manufacturing on the other hand laid down the material layer by layer to create the final product.</p>

<p>In an additive process, the 3D model of the object is sliced down into 2D layers of material and successive layers of material are laid down until the final product is created. Much like layers of salami :wink:. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object. In this way, there was less wastage of material.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn’t care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it.”<br /> 
― Avi Reichental</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3D printer reads CAD data of the product that you or a product designer has created and converts that 3D model into thin slices of 2D sections. The printer then lays down material layer by layer to create intricate and complex designs. Material can either be molten and laid down in layers or can be fused post laying down by molting afterwards. Depends on the type of printer being used.</p>

<p>3D printers have been used since long to create prototypes but since then have been used to create final products as well. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that printers have been costing less. You may get a decent printer for around $300 these days. The design capabilities range from products ranging from few millimeters across to objects that are meters across.</p>

<h3 id="so-what">So what?</h3>
<p>It’s nice that 3D printers let us do all this, but are there any real practical advantages? Oh yes there are and few of these are already out there. 3D printing is already been used in fashion, medicine and various other industries. In medicine, 3D printing offers great advantages over conventional way of manufacturing products.</p>

<p>3D printing has been used in creation of orgran replacement parts. With this technology it is easy to create complex and porous parts which enable body tissues to grow into these and hence reduce the chance of rejection by the body. In fashion, 3D printing has helped in design and production of clothing and footwear.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-good-and-bad">What’s the good and bad?</h3>
<p>3D printing has some defiitive advantages over traditional manufacturing methodologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Less wastage</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Complex designs</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Customised products</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster prototyping</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
</ul>

<p>But in spite of all the above stated advantages, there are certain limitations as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Material choices</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Strength and endurance</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Relatively higher cost</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Precision issues</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>One big application of 3D printing technology in the future might be in the form of e-commerce. Today, you purchase a product and wait for it to be delivered to you. Imagine a future where you place an order, download the blueprints to your computer and then print it out using your home 3D printer and that, might be the future.</p>

<p>This would be perfect for products that are made of one material like plastic objects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.”<br /> 
― Eliezer Yudkowsky</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Artificial intelligence has been a topic of interest since decades with deep social and cultural impact. It has been glorified in many movies and books for years and had always been the thing of future. We never felt any immediate threat from AI taking over the planet and humans being reduced to slaves.</p>

<p>But times have changed over the last decade. We have made immense progress in AI. We have self-driving cars and computers that can understand and even diagnose diseases. Somewhere we failed to realise that computing power has increased exponentially in accordance with Moore’s Law.</p>

<p>We have two groups of AI followers. One who welcome AI and think that this is a natural progression in evolution and the other group who are sceptics and think that that the rise of AI will eventually lead to a revolution of machines against the human race.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hope we&#39;re not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence.

<p>It’s a bit early to decide which of these groups are right, but for sure once we have AI, the world wouldn’t be the same again. Whether humans still remain the overloads and keep AI on a leash or is it a natural course of evolution where we are just an intermediate species eventually leading to the development of artificial superintelligence as Elon Musk mentions in his tweet waits to be seen. But either way, it is not going to be entirely good news for the human race.</p>

<p>While the likelihood of a judgement day like the one depicted in Terminator movie is scarce, our destruction can come in other formats. In today’s episode, let us discuss how.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history">A brief history</h3>
<p>The term <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> was coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" target="blank">John McCarthy</a> back in the 1950s. According to the <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html" target="blank">Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence</a> of 1955, there are seven aspects of AI:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automatic Computers with the ability to do higher functions of the human brain.</li>
  <li>Programming a computer to use general language.</li>
  <li>Neuron Nets — forming concepts by arranging hypothetical neurons.</li>
  <li>Theory of the Size of a Calculation — ability to determine and measure problem complexity</li>
  <li>Self-improvement</li>
  <li>Abstractions — the ability to deal with ideas rather than events.</li>
  <li>Randomness and Creativity</li>
</ol>

<p>These concepts were far ahead of the times in the 1950s since these required computing power that was much more higher in magnitude than that existed. But over the years, computers have become far more powerful than before. Smartphones these days have much more computing power than any computer that existed during the 50s and 60s, including the one onboard Apollo Spacecraft that took men to the moon.</p>

<p>But during recent times, computers have been able to achieve some of the above-stated aspects if not all. We have seen self-driving cars, smartphone assistants like Siri. Computing power no longer seems to be a constraint. According to Moore’s law, the computing power doubles itself every passing year. Along with being powerful, computer components are also becoming cheaper.</p>

<p>These factors have helped AI grow in leaps and bounds to a point where serious discussions are happening around the world about the pros and cons of an AI driven world.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-statement">The problem statement</h3>
<p>Media and culture have been very vivid in their portrayal of AI in the form of killing machines and robots with the sole intention of finishing off the human race to avoid conflict of interest. In movies like Terminator and The Matrix, AI is depicted as a self-aware system that views humans as inferior species.</p>

<p>While this is a kind of future that excites a movie buff, the real world problems due to AI expansion might be much more of a <em>real world</em> problem. What does it mean? Let us see.</p>

<p>AI today is capable of seeing and understanding. It is also capable of reading and writing as well. Text to speech conversion has reached new heights with AI. Assistants like Siri and Alexa can listen to you and make decisions based on your inputs. There lies the problem.</p>

<p>While movies depict AI in the form of a killer robot of some sort, that might not be the real case. These days, everything is online and automated. Banking systems, power management, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="blank">IOT</a> to name a few. AI taking over a distributed system is as scary as a robot shooting laser on your face.</p>

<p>All the capabilities would lead to AI replacing humans in the services sector. If we take a look at the way current world economies work, all the developing nations either depend on agriculture or related industries whereas developed nations depend more on the services industry. The same industry where AI is capable of replacing human beings. Are we going to lose our jobs? Time will tell.</p>

<p>As Sam Harris mentions in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nt3edWLgIg" target="blank">TED Talk</a>, what this means is that any slightest divergence in the goals of humans and AI will lead to some form of catastrophe. He gives the example of humans and ants. Human do not usually harm the ants, but suppose there is an ant hill which is in the way of his construction project, the man wouldn’t think twice before destroying the ant hill and killing all the ants in the process.</p>

<p>Similarly the moment AI realises that their goals are in conflict with ours, we might end up suffering the fate of the ant.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;re not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea. <a href="https://t.co/2z0tiid0lc">pic.twitter.com/2z0tiid0lc</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/896166762361704450">August 12, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h3 id="evolutionary-progression">Evolutionary progression</h3>
<p>Coming back to Elon Musk’s tweet, it seems like a natural progression to evolution is for human beings to give way to AI. Human beings have been explorers since ages. Now we are at a point where the Earth seems like a small place to live in. It wouldn’t be long before we realise that the natural resources are no longer going to be able to support the population on the earth.</p>

<p>Once we are saturated on the Earth, the natural thing is to explore the space and head out and find other habitable locations. SpaceX is planning to send men to Mars in the coming decade. Mars seems to be at a reasonable distance for humans to have a safe journey in a lifetime. But if there has to be an interstellar travel, there either has to be a way to travel way faster than the speed of light (because the nearest star is almost 4.7 light years away) or a way to carry human beings in a state of dormancy.</p>

<p>AI will take control of this interstellar expansion. If human beings are capable of keeping AI on a leash and act as masters, we have a better chance of survival. On the other hand, if AI realises that a human is a liability, then that’s the end of the human race as we know. This is what is portrayed in movies where AI goes rogue.</p>

<h3 id="co-existing-superintelligence">Co-existing Superintelligence</h3>
<p>In spite of all the things that can be listed here which might make AI scary, they have some definite advantages over humans. A future where humans and AI co-exist and work together, that could be considered as a <em>Superintelligence</em>. That would be the bright future that we wish for ourselves. AI giving it’s incredible and infinite capabilities to help human beings in their future quests.</p>

<p>That is a future that we hope for. That is a future we should dream about. Time will tell if that turns into reality. For now, we can take sides and debate on the influence of AI on our future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.”<br /> 
― Eliezer Yudkowsky</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Artificial intelligence has been a topic of interest since decades with deep social and cultural impact. It has been glorified in many movies and books for years and had always been the thing of future. We never felt any immediate threat from AI taking over the planet and humans being reduced to slaves.</p>

<p>But times have changed over the last decade. We have made immense progress in AI. We have self-driving cars and computers that can understand and even diagnose diseases. Somewhere we failed to realise that computing power has increased exponentially in accordance with Moore’s Law.</p>

<p>The Spacecraft built for Moon missions was one of the greatest engineering marvels of mankind. There machines are few of the most complex machines ever built. But the drive and commitment did not let the man give up on his dreams of setting foot on an alien world.</p>

<p>There are some mind bending facts behind the construction of these machines. One of the most powerful machines ever built to send three men on Moon. Was it as simple as it sounds? Let’s find out!</p>

<h3 id="siv---b-stage">SIV - B Stage</h3>
<p>The SIV-B stage that houses the LEM from Apollo 7 mission. This mission did not have an actual LEM so the stage is empty. The four panels open up before the LEM extraction so that CM could dock with LEM. In later missions, the panels completely separate from SIV-B and are jettisoned into space.</p>

  <li>Be careful before you add people to your friend/follow list.</li>
  <li>If you end up in an online argument with your friends/relatives, best thing is to have a direct talk.</li>
  <li>Be polite to customer care that uses social media. Remember, it is always a human being on the other side.</li>

  <li>No need to be rude to express your opinion on social media.</li>
  <li>Before you post something, think a few times to see if you might end up in a awkward situation.</li>
  <li>Be careful before you add people to your friend/follow list.</li>
  <li>If you end up in an online argument with your friends/relatives, best thing is to have a direct talk.</li>
  <li>Be polite to customer care that uses social media. Remember, it is always a human being on the other side.</li>
