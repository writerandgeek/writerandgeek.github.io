<ul>
  <li>Formula one is the highest class of racing sanctioned by FIA.</li>
  <li>The inaugural season was in 1950.</li>
  <li>A season consists of races called Grand Prix (Grand Prize in French).</li>
  <li>“Formula” is set of rules to be followed by the manufacturers and the drivers.</li>
  <li>One of the fastest type of races owing to the aerodynamic design of cars.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grand Prix Motor Racing</strong>: A precursor to the modern day Formula One racing.</li>
  <li>Started in France in 1894. Involved racing from one town to the next.</li>
  <li>Evolved into endurance races.</li>
  <li>High rate of fatality owing to poor safety standards.</li>
  <li>Post World War II, evolved into Formula One.</li>
  <li>Was a medium for car manufacturers to promote their cars. French has special interest in motor cars.</li>
  <li>First racing took place on <strong>July 22, 1894</strong> organised by <strong>Le Petit Journal</strong> between Paris and Rouen distance of 126 km.</li>
  <li><strong>Count Jules-Albert de Dion</strong> won the race in 6 hours 48 minutes at an average speed of 19 km/h (12 mph) and 3 mins the 30s ahead of the runner-up.</li>
  <li><strong>James Gordon Bennett Jr.</strong>, who was the owner of New York Herald, started the Gordon Bennett cup which was an international event with countries participating against each other.</li>
  <li>Each country entered up to three cars in the even and the cars were fully manufactured in those particular countries.</li>
  <li>Each country had their racing colours (Green for UK, Red for Italy etc.).</li>
  <li>After fatalities in the Paris-Madrid race, a closed circuit was used in Ireland at Athy in 1903 and was the first closed circuit race.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grand-prix">Grand Prix</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automobile Club de France</strong> organised regular races that were called Grad Prix races starting 1906.</li>
  <li>A circuit which was roughly triangular in shape situated in Le Mans was used with a lap distance of 105 km.</li>
  <li>A total of six laps were required to be covered per day with a lap taking around an hour of each car.</li>
  <li>Use of the circuit was a direct result of the 1903 Paris-Madrid race which resulted in the death of drivers and pedestrians were killed.</li>
  <li>Races were mostly nationalistic and had cars with 50hp, 10-15L engines. Each car carried a mechanic along with a driver and they were the only ones allowed to work on the car.</li>
  <li>Renault won the Grand Prix by using detachable wheel rims developed by Michelin.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pre-world-war-ii-days">Pre World War II days</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Monaco Grand Prix was the first time race grid was determined by using qualifying time rather than using a lucky draw.</li>
  <li>By the late 1930s, mechanics had long gone and cars were single seaters. Also, they were 600hp 8 or 16 cylindered monsters by this time.</li>
  <li>Mercedes and Auto Union dominated due to support from Nazis.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="post-war">Post war</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Post war, Formula One took shape in 1950.</li>
  <li>Due to economic difficulties, 1952 and 53 races were held using Formula 2 cars.</li>
  <li>First Word Championship race was held on May 13 in Silverstone, UK.</li>
  <li>The first championship was won by Italian Giuseppe (Nino) Farina driving an Alfa Romeo in 1950 defeating Juan Manuel Fangio.</li>
  <li>Fangio later went on to win five world championships which were a record for 45 years until Schumacher broke the record in 2003.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-routine">The routine</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Usually 12 teams compete with two drivers each.</li>
  <li>Race weekend consists of <em>free practice</em>, <em>qualifying session</em> and <em>race</em>.</li>
  <li>To participate in a race, a driver should complete at least one lap in the free practice session.</li>
  <li>Free practice usually happens on Fridays except for Monaco Grand Prix, where the practice happens on Thursday and Fridays are reserved for other activities.</li>
  <li>Qualifying consists of three sessions namely <em>Q1, Q2 and Q3</em>. Cars are ranked according to their lap time.</li>
  <li>During Q1 and Q2, 7 drivers are eliminated respectively leaving 10 drivers in Q3.</li>
  <li>The driver with the fastest time gets the <em>pole</em> position - the first on the grid.</li>
  <li>After qualification, cars are inclosed park, meaning that no significant changes can be done to the settings.</li>
  <li>Top ten cars have to start using the same tires that they set the lap times on. In few cases they can be replaced by a set of similar tyres subject to approvals.</li>
  <li>On the race day, the cars are aligned on the grid according to the grid locations decided as per qualifying on the previous day.</li>
  <li>Race is usually held around 2 pm on the Sunday for most of the European races. Some races like Singapore and Abu Dhabi happen during the evenings.</li>
  <li>Number of laps is selected so that the total distance is more than 305 km except for Monaco where the minimum race distance is set at 260km. Also the race time cannot exceed 2 hours and in case that happens the race positions at the 2 hour mark would be considered to be the final grid positions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-car">The car</h2>

<h3 id="engine">Engine</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The chassis is made using carbon fibre and other ultralight materials to save weight and for safety.</li>
  <li>Minimum permissible weight is 728kg including the driver without fuel.</li>
  <li>Sometimes ballast was used to add weight and lower the center of gravity.</li>
  <li>Prior to 2006, cars had V10 engines with 3 litre engines producing close to 1000 hp with top speeds reaching 375kph.</li>
  <li>In 2006, FIA came up with a rule that stated all cars must have a naturally aspirated (no turbocharger or supercharger) 2.4 litre V8 engines. Turbochargers were banned in 1989.</li>
  <li>Since 2014, engines are 1.6l turbocharged for an improved fuel efficiency of 29%.</li>
  <li>In 2009 engines were limited to 18,000 rpm for engine reliability.</li>
  <li>Engines consume close to 450lof air per second.</li>
  <li>Engine is located between driver and the rear axle and forms a structural support of the car.</li>
  <li>In 2004, engines were required to last a race weekend and subsequently the number of engines that could be used for a season were reduced to 8 and now to 3. That means an engine has to last for more than one race which would reduce the cost and make the units more reliable.
-Fuel used is similar to normal petrol with a controlled mix and FIA requires fuel suppliers to submit samples for testing and can ask for a sample at any time during the course of a season.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transmission">Transmission</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All cars have a semi-automatic gearbox with 8 forward and 1 backward gears.</li>
  <li>Carbon-titanium is used to make gearbox and is connected right behind the engine.</li>
  <li>Paddles behind the steering wheels are used to upshift and downshift.</li>
  <li>Clutch is controlled by electro-hydraulics except when starting from a standstill when the driver operates a lever in the steering wheel.</li>
  <li>Limitations exist on the number of gearboxes over a season as well. Gearboxes must complete six consecutive races before being replaced.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steering-wheel">Steering wheel</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Steering wheel houses many controls including gear shift, rev. limiter, fuel mix controller etc.</li>
  <li>Data related to various parameters are also displayed in LCD displays on the wheel.</li>
  <li>They weight around 1.3kg and can cost up to $50,000.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tyres">Tyres</h3>
<p>Tyres used are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hypersoft</li>
  <li>Ultrasoft</li>
  <li>Supersoft</li>
  <li>Soft</li>
  <li>Medium</li>
  <li>Hard</li>
  <li>Superhard</li>
  <li>Intermediate(for partially wet conditions)</li>
  <li>Wet (rain tyres)
During rain, wet tyres can remove almost 250l of water a second from the track.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-systems">Other systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Aerodynamics are controlled by using spoilers in the front and rear.</li>
  <li>If the throttle is let go, the aerodynamic drag will slow down the car at the same rate at which a sports car decelerates under breaking.</li>
  <li>KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) is used to give the car additional boost and stores the energy dissipated while braking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-facts">Some facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Car costs anywhere between 6 to 8 millions.</li>
  <li>Around 800 parts.</li>
  <li>Engine normally lasts for few races. Earlier it was an engine per week. Revs up to 16,000 - 18,000 RPM.</li>
  <li>Tyres last for around 90-120 km.</li>
  <li>Can accelerate from 0 to 160 kph back to 0 in 4 sec.</li>
  <li>Drivers lose close to 3-4 kg every race.</li>
  <li>At 130 kph, car has a downforce equal to its weight and can go upside down in a tunnel. Flight principles reversed.</li>
  <li>Roughly 2600-3000 gear shifts, Monaco has the most number of shifts.</li>
  <li>1200 litres of fuel is used per race weekend. Efficiency of 70l/100km.</li>
  <li>Brake discs reach temperatures of 1000°C, exhaust pipe reaches 900°C and tyres reach 130°C during a race.</li>
  <li>Champagne tradition started in 1950, locals fans presented a three litre bottle of champagne to the race winner Fangio.</li>
  <li>In 1966, Jo Siffert in 24 hours of Le Mans opened a bottle of champagne which wasn’t sufficiently cooled. The cork flew up and resulted in the drink splashing on everyone. This tradition continues to this day with the exception of Bahrain Grand Prix where it champagne is replaced with sparkling fruit juice.</li>
  <li>In 2005, a BAR Honda car set an unofficial speed record of 413kph at Bonneville Speedway.</li>

				<itunes:subtitle>In this episode we discuss the history of Pioneer 10.</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: NASA was established in 1958 as opposed to 1959 as mentioned by Shankar.</em></p>

<p>Pioneer 10 (Pioneer F) was the first aircraft to give humans an insight into the planet Jupiter and its moons. It was the first mission to Jupiter. It was part of the Pioneer program, a series of United States unmanned space missions launched between 1958 and 1978.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives:</h3>
<p>Document Jupiter, its environment and its moon (mainly Europa, Callisto, Io, Ganymede) through photographs (Jovian System)
Study the solar wind, cosmic rays, heliosphere, and far reaches of the Solar System
Explore the atmosphere and radioactivity of the planet
Study the outer Solar System and heliosphere exploration
Study the asteroid belt</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Gary Flandro, an aerospace engineer, conceived a mission to exploit a rare outer planets’ alignment.
The space probe was manufactured by TRW Inc. They were given a combined $380 million contract in 1970 to build Pioneer 10 and 11.
It took 25 million man-hours
As per a TRW engineer, “This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.”</p>

<h3 id="spacecraft-and-design">Spacecraft and Design:</h3>
<p>Six 76-centimetres long panels attached to a 36-centimetres bus to form a hexagonal structure. It could host eight to eleven instruments which were protected in a honeycomb aluminium structure. The orientation of the probe was controlled by the use of propellant (conical scanning). Aluminized mylar and kapton blankets (insulation coating) for passive thermal control. It carried 36 kilograms of liquid hydrazine monopropellant with a total launch mass of 260 kilograms.</p>

<p>It used four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) powered by plutonium-238. The spacecraft needed 100 Watts to power all the equipment. At launch, it provided a combined 155 W, and 140 W while in transit to Jupiter. By 2001, it became 65W leading to operation of only selected instruments.</p>

<p>Mission computation was largely performed on Earth with the commands transmitted to the spacecraft. It had a meagre capacity of 6,144 bytes, a limited form of a processor, two command decoders and one distributor which required ground control to prepare commands in advance.</p>

<h3 id="plaque">Plaque:</h3>
<p>Pioneer 10 contains a gold plaque which provides information about the origin of the spacecraft. Designed by Dr Carl Sagan and Dr Frank Drake, it was drawn by Linda Salzman Sagan. The plaque consists of diagrams of a man and a woman, completely nude. It also has the diagram showing the position of our solar system in the galaxy and the chemical information about hydrogen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: NASA was established in 1958 as opposed to 1959 as mentioned by Shankar.</em></p>

<p>Pioneer 10 (Pioneer F) was the first aircraft to give humans an insight into the planet Jupiter and its moons. It was the first mission to Jupiter. It was part of the Pioneer program, a series of United States unmanned space missions launched between 1958 and 1978.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives:</h3>
<p>Document Jupiter, its environment and its moon (mainly Europa, Callisto, Io, Ganymede) through photographs (Jovian System)
Study the solar wind, cosmic rays, heliosphere, and far reaches of the Solar System
Explore the atmosphere and radioactivity of the planet
Study the outer Solar System and heliosphere exploration
Study the asteroid belt</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Gary Flandro, an aerospace engineer, conceived a mission to exploit a rare outer planets’ alignment.
The space probe was manufactured by TRW Inc. They were given a combined $380 million contract in 1970 to build Pioneer 10 and 11.
It took 25 million man-hours
As per a TRW engineer, “This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.”</p>

<h3 id="spacecraft-and-design">Spacecraft and Design:</h3>
<p>Six 76-centimetres long panels attached to a 36-centimetres bus to form a hexagonal structure. It could host eight to eleven instruments which were protected in a honeycomb aluminium structure. The orientation of the probe was controlled by the use of propellant (conical scanning). Aluminized mylar and kapton blankets (insulation coating) for passive thermal control. It carried 36 kilograms of liquid hydrazine monopropellant with a total launch mass of 260 kilograms.</p>

<p>It used four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) powered by plutonium-238. The spacecraft needed 100 Watts to power all the equipment. At launch, it provided a combined 155 W, and 140 W while in transit to Jupiter. By 2001, it became 65W leading to operation of only selected instruments.</p>

<p>Mission computation was largely performed on Earth with the commands transmitted to the spacecraft. It had a meagre capacity of 6,144 bytes, a limited form of a processor, two command decoders and one distributor which required ground control to prepare commands in advance.</p>

<h3 id="plaque">Plaque:</h3>
<p>Pioneer 10 contains a gold plaque which provides information about the origin of the spacecraft. Designed by Dr Carl Sagan and Dr Frank Drake, it was drawn by Linda Salzman Sagan. The plaque consists of diagrams of a man and a woman, completely nude. It also has the diagram showing the position of our solar system in the galaxy and the chemical information about hydrogen.</p>

Though safe and effective birth control came into existence only in the 20th century, ways to prevent pregnancy have been devised since ancient times. Birth control has been the centre of many controversies as well.</p>

<p>For pregnancy to occur, sperm must flow up the vagina, through the cervical opening into uterus into one of the fallopian tubes. If an egg is present in the tube, one sperm could fertilise it. Contraceptives either block the sperm kills it before it reaches uterus or prevents ovulation.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-birth-control">History of birth control</h3>

  <li>Cave paintings from 15,000 years ago in France apparently depicted condoms.</li>
  <li><strong>Ebers Papyrus</strong>, an Egyptian medical papyrus from around 1550 BC and <strong>Kahun Papyrus</strong> from 1850 BC have documented some form of birth control from the ancient Egyptian times. These used honey, acacia leaves etc to be placed in the vagina to block sperm.</li>
  <li>Chinese used Mercury and Lead cocktail that lead to sterility, brain damage, kidney failure and death.</li>
  <li>Things like acacia gums were used to be placed inside the vagina. Acacia has spermatocide properties.</li>
  <li>Other ways were to cover the vagina using gummy substances, sodium carbonate and a mixture made of crocodile dung.</li>
  <li>Less effective <strong>coitus interruptus</strong> (withdrawal) was also practiced.</li>
  <li>Greek physician <strong>Soranus</strong> advised women to hold their breath and sneeze after the intercourse in 200 A.D.</li>
  <li>Botanist <strong>Theophrastus</strong> mentioned the use of <strong>Siphilium</strong>, a plant that could induce abortion and had contraceptive abilities. It grew scarcely near the city of Cyrene (Libya) and it’s scarcity made it valuable more than it’s weight in Silver in 1<sup>st</sup> century B.C.</li>
  <li>Indians used a combination of rock salt, honey and elephant dung.</li>
  <li>Olive oil and cedar oil combinations were used in Greece.</li>
  <li>Steaming technique using hot stones and medicated solutions were used to kill sperms. Later a modification using a pipe to push steam into vagina was used in medieval Europe, which often resulted in burns.</li>
  <li>An Indian tradition of sitting on a steaming pot of onion and water was used by Jewish women in Manhattan.</li>
  <li>Lactation for a longer time was also used as way to prevent pregnancy.</li>
  <li>During middle ages, women believed tying weasel testicles to their thighs would prevent pregnancy.</li>
  <li>Giacomo Casanova used partially squeezed lemon halves as cervical cap. Team of Australian scientists found out that lemon juice could indeed kill sperms.</li>
  <li>Animal intestines condoms were widely used in 1600s and in 1700s, linen was also used. They weren’s throw away stuff.</li>
  <li>In the mid-1800s vulcanised rubber was patented and condoms came into use.</li>
  <li>Anti-obscenity laws prevented women from gaining access to condoms in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup>centuries. Lizol and Coke were used. Diet coke was effective in killing sperm but not fast enough.</li>
  <li>In 1960, oral pills were approved.</li>

<p>Timekeeping became a necessity when humans started being social. As with everything on earth, it all started with Sun. Being the source of a vast amount of energy in the form of light, what better way of tracking time than to use that light.</p>

<h2 id="egyptians---the-timemasters">Egyptians - the timemasters</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Obelisks</strong>: An Egyptian invention. Shadows are tracked to calculate the time of day.</li>
  <li><strong>Sundial</strong>: A device that uses shadow cast by sunlight to measure time as the sun moves overhead. Egyptians used these in B.C. 3500. In 1500 B.C. Egyptians built a more accurate sundial which was divided into 10 parts. This one was accurate only half the time and afternoon it had to be rotated by 180°</li>
  <li>Issues:
    <ul>
      <li>Path of sun changes throughout the year.</li>
      <li>Doesn’t work on rainy or overcast days.</li>
      <li>Doesn’t work during the night.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Water Clocks</strong>: Used mostly as time measuring devices.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mechanical-clocks">Mechanical Clocks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First mechanical clocks might have been used in monasteries to keep monks aware of the prayer times.</li>
  <li>Most of these were large weight driven “turret” clocks which stuck at every hour and did not have a face or a hand.</li>
  <li>Salisbury Cathedral in England has the oldest clock which chimes every hour. These type of clocks had errors of up to half an hour a day and weren’t accurate.</li>
  <li>During mid of the 1400s, German and Italian clockmakers started making clocks that made use of wound spring. Most of these had only hour hands and the minute hand came into existence only during the 1650s.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pendulums">Pendulums</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Master inventor Galileo devised the timekeeping property of pendulum and in 1656, Christiaan Huygens started using the pendulum as a time controller in clocks.</li>
  <li>The time period of a pendulum was independent of the mass of the pendulum and to the extent of the swing, but depended only on the length of the pendulum. A pendulum of around 99 cm (39 inches) has a time period of around 1 sec. Even an increase in length by 0.025 mm would make a difference of 1 sec in a day. Which means a steel pendulum can lose up to a second a day with a temperature variation of 2.2°C. A special alloy called “Invar” which has a small co-efficient of expansion is sometimes used to make pendulums.</li>
  <li>A series of clocks which were weight driven and had pendulums were devised and built. Due to their weight they were not suitable for hanging from the wall, instead, the casing was extended towards the ground and this led to the creation of “Grandfather” clocks.</li>
  <li>In 1670 the seconds pendulum was added to the clock which oscillated once every second.</li>
  <li>An escape wheel is used which is allowed to rotate one tooth per double swing of the pendulum and also transmits the impulse to the pendulum.</li>
  <li>Escapement has two main functions: transmit the impulse without hampering the free swing and to transmit a uniform impulse.</li>
  <li>Edmund Beckett invented a gravity clock using double three-legged gravity escapement and used this for Westminster which we adorably call <strong>The Big Ben</strong> :wink:.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-components">The Components</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Escapement</strong>: Escapement is used to transfer the gravitational force acting on the weights to the clock’s mechanism. In this mechanism, a weight unwinds a rope from a barrel which turns the toothed escape wheel. A vertical rod with pellets at each end called a verge is used. When the weight drops and the wheel rotates, the top pallet arrests the wheel resulting in oscillation on the regulating weights. This oscillation turns the verge and that releases the wheel from the pellet until it is caught by the second pellet on the other side of the verge. This process is repeated. This action produces the “tick-tock”.</li>
  <li><strong>The wheelwork</strong>: This mechanism, also called the <em>train</em> is responsible for transmitting the motion from the weight or spring mechanism to the hands of the clock through a series of wheels and pinions precisely calibrated to ensure steady transmission of power. There is a gearing mechanism that drives the clock and uses a 12:1 gearing ratio to move the hour hand.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="electric-clocks">Electric Clocks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First made in 1840, the first electric clock had a pendulum and spring mechanism and used an electrical impulse to operate a number of dials.</li>
  <li>The first complete electric clock was invented in 1906.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="quart-crystals">Quart crystals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Quartz crystal was first used in clocks in 1929. A big leap in precise timekeeping.</li>
  <li>A ring of quartz of 2.5 mm in diameter is suspended by threads in a heat-resistant chamber. Electrodes are connected to the surface of the ring and the 100,000 hertz frequency of vibration is reduced by a process called <em>frequency division</em> and applied to a synchronous motor.</li>
  <li>6 million to 1 ratio of gearing is used to move the second hand and the precision is of the order of one second every 10 years.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="watches">Watches</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Watches came into use around the 1500s. Peter Henlein, a locksmith from Germany made early models of watches using verge as the escapement method.</li>
  <li>Germany and France produced early watches which were not wrist watches but were worn on chains around the neck.</li>
  <li>These early watches had no minute or second hands and had only hour hands.</li>
  <li>Early watches used wound up springs, which were coil springs that could be wound up to store energy. This energy is then transferred using wheel train and escapement.</li>
  <li>The major drawback was the change in torque as the spring unwinds. This was countered by use of <em>fusee</em>, a cone-shaped, grooved pulley system that kept the torque constant by the variable diameter of the cone.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="navigation-and-need-for-precision">Navigation and need for precision</h2>
<p>Navigators needed to have accurate ways of determining the time to also determine their location.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Latitude could be calculated based on the position of sun’s angle at noon.</li>
  <li>Time at a reference point was necessary to identify the longitude. At equator 15° change in latitude is equivalent to an hours difference in time.</li>
  <li>Pendulums do not work well at sea.</li>
  <li>In 1714, the Engish government promised a reward of £20,000 to anyone who can measure longitude to the accuracy of 0.5° which corresponds to an error of 35 miles at the equator and an accuracy of 3 s/day.</li>
  <li>The prize was won by John Harrison who made the sea going H4 clocks with the accuracy of 0.2 s/day with the error of only 30 km on a 7-day trip.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="greenwich-mean-time">Greenwich Mean Time</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Set as a standard in 1884.</li>
  <li>Since the path of the sun varies, there was a deviation of +/- 15 mins. Hence mean annual average of motion of sun was considered.</li>
  <li>1 second = 1/864,000 of a mean day.</li>
  <li>Issues:
    <ul>
      <li>Variation in earth’s rotation.</li>
      <li>Weather</li>
      <li>Tides</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Replaced by UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) which is pretty much similar to GMT and is maintained by an ensemble of around 260 clocks maintained in 40 countries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="atomic-clocks">Atomic clocks</h3>
<p>Atomic clocks were a major breakthrough in the development of highly accurate clocks for use in various scientific devices and in modern exploration including space.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1955: Cesium atomic clock was invented by Essen and Parry at National Physical Laboratory.</li>
  <li>More clocks were reproduced in the following years and Caesium clocks were adopted as the basis for time measurement.</li>
  <li>Present day atomic clocks have an accuracy of 1 sec in 3 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="working-of-atomic-clock">Working of atomic clock</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Uses quantum mechanical states of energy and precise energy levels of electrons.</li>
  <li>The frequency at which Cesium releases peak energy is calculated and time is calculated accordingly.</li>
  <li>High precision. Used in space technology where nanosecond level of precision is required.</li>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h2 id="world-runs-on-coffee">World runs on coffee</h2>
<p>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages on the planet alongside water and tea. It is the second most traded commodity after oil. Coffee has also given rise to a culture of coffee shops or coffee houses which seems to be a recent phenomenon. But are they really a thing of 21<sup>st</sup> century or do they have some history? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3 id="beverage-of-choice">Beverage of choice</h3>
<p>Coffee is a magical drink of choice. Its ever-increasing popularity can be attributed to its versatility and of course <strong>Caffeine</strong> the magic alkaloid that gives you bliss as you sip your coffee down.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The coffee plant originated in Africa</li>
  <li>Two different variety of Coffee:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arabica</strong>: The more popular and expensive variety, this is considered to be milder and more flavourful. The bean is flatter and elongated and requires a cool sub-tropical climate.  Typically grows around the elevation ranging from 2000 - 6500 ft where it needs sun, moisture and shade. Largest producers of Arabica are <strong>Latin America</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong>, <strong>Arabia</strong> and <strong>East Africa</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Robusta</strong>: This is cheaper to produce but has almost twice the quantity of caffeine than the <strong>Arabica</strong> coffee. Robusta beans are rounder and can grow at lower altitudes (sea level - 2000 ft.). <strong>Central and Western Africa</strong>, <strong>South East Asia</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong> are the leading producers of Robusta.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history-of-coffee">History of Coffee</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Coffee plants grew in the wild in the area called Kefa or Kaffa in Ethiopia. These plants were taken to Arabia and cultivated around the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li>Legend is attributed to a goatherd by the name <strong>Kaldi</strong> who noticed that his heard started behaving weirdly after eating certain berries. He tasted them and felt ecstatic as well. He made coffee popular according to the legend.</li>
  <li>Since it was an intoxicating drink, Islam forbade drinking coffee since such drinks are prohibited by Quran.</li>
  <li>Despite the risk, coffee lovers grew in leaps and bounds within Arabia and drink became popular.</li>
  <li>This paved way for the creation of “Coffeehouses” called <strong>Qahveh Khanehs</strong> and gave rise to the coffee house culture. They first appeared in Mecca around the 15<sup>th</sup> century and were popular places to catch up with friends.</li>
  <li>Coffee came to Europe around 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries and spread across Europe.</li>
  <li>Some countries prohibited coffee stating they are magical potions.</li>
  <li>Coffee houses became popular in Britain and British colonies by 17<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li><strong>Yemen</strong> was almost the only supplier of coffee until the close of 17<sup>th</sup> century. But the popularity of the beverage took it all the way to <strong>Java</strong> in Indonesia and Americas along with Hawaii (since 1825).</li>
  <li>By 20th century Brazil became a leading producer and exporter of Coffee.</li>
  <li>In 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, coffee machines came into existence and various new methods of producing coffee came into being.</li>
  <li>Instant coffee came into popularity and production was perfected post-1950 leading to the increased production of Robusta.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="caffeine---the-magical-ingredient">Caffeine - the magical ingredient</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Caffeine is an alkaloid which is present in coffee, tea, cocoa and in some other nuts and berries.</li>
  <li>It normally is a white powder highly soluble in hot water.</li>
  <li>Caffeine stimulates central nervous system, heart and kidneys. It is also a mild diuretic (removes urine).</li>
  <li>Used as an antidote to respiratory depression caused by overdose.</li>
  <li>Negative effects: Insomnia, anxiety, irritation etc.</li>
  <li>Positive effects: Increased alertness and improved motor performance.</li>
  <li>Decaffeinated coffee became popular to control the amount of coffee in the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="production-of-coffee">Production of coffee</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee cherries contain coffee beans, usually two. Single beaned berries are called <strong>pea beans</strong> and are said to be sweeter and flavourful.</li>
  <li>Beans are separated from the berries and the dried to reduce the moisture content from 65-70% down to 12-13%.</li>
  <li>Three techniques are used for processing coffee:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dry method</strong>: In this process, the berries are placed under the sun on concrete or brick patios. This is the simplest way of processing and is least expensive. Practised in areas with dry and warm climate like Ethiopia and Brazil. The berries are raked to move them around and to prevent fermentation. The process takes few days to around four weeks. Overdrying breaks the coffee and underlying causes fungi and other bacteria attack. Once dried, the coffee beans are separated by machinery.</li>
      <li><strong>Wet method</strong>: This method produces better quality coffee and requires much more sophisticated equipment than the dry method. The skin and the pulp are removed using a pulping machine that uses a rotating drum. The thin layer of pulp that still remains is removed by fermentation that happens over three days as the wet seeds are kept in tanks. Remaining pulp is washed off and the beans are dried under the sun or by passing hot air.</li>
      <li><strong>Pulped natural process</strong>: In this third way of processing, the pulp is removed mechanically but there is no intermediate fermentation and the remaining pulp is removed once the beans dry off. This is a combination of dry and wet techniques. The beans produced in this method are both sweet and acidic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Post the processing the coffee is graded and stored.</p>

<h3 id="roasting-and-grinding">Roasting and Grinding</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee beans are roasted between 180-250 °C from 7-20 mins releasing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water.</li>
  <li>The beans lose weight and expand under the roasting process.</li>
  <li>Roasting gives the aroma to the coffee.</li>
  <li>Overroasting kills the flavour which is done in the case of Robusta beans to remove the strong coffee flavour.</li>
  <li>The old method was to roast coffee beans in a rotating metal cylinder above a source of heat. Modern method uses hot air to roast the beans. Rotation ensures even roasting.</li>
  <li>Grinding is either done before packaging or done by the consumer depending on the brew method involved. We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" target="_blank">French Press</a>, hence coarsely ground coffee is what purchase.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="packaging-and-brewing">Packaging and Brewing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee needs to be sealed airtight to prevent moisture from reaching it.</li>
  <li>Modern methods use inert gas and aluminium or polyethene compounds.</li>
  <li>Different methods of brewing:
    <ul>
      <li>French Press</li>
      <li>Pour over</li>
      <li>Moka Pot</li>
      <li>Aeropress</li>
      <li>Cold brewing</li>
      <li>Espresso</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instant coffee is a soluble coffee concentrate which does not need to be brewed but the flavour is usually inferior to brewed coffee.</li>
  <li>Kopi Luwak (Civet coffee).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="decaf">Decaf</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For people who do not tolerate caffeine, it is removed from the coffee using chemical solvents, carbon filtering or carbon dioxide extraction. Caffeine is extracted just before roasting.</li>
  <li>The chemical agent is either used to treat the beans directly or the water-based solution in which the beans are soaked.</li>
  <li>Swiss water process is used to get more flavourful beans. The first batch of beans are processed in hot water and that water is used for washing the next bath of the beans.</li>
  <li>100% decaf is not a possibility.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="world-runs-on-coffee">World runs on coffee</h2>
<p>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages on the planet alongside water and tea. It is the second most traded commodity after oil. Coffee has also given rise to a culture of coffee shops or coffee houses which seems to be a recent phenomenon. But are they really a thing of 21<sup>st</sup> century or do they have some history? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3 id="beverage-of-choice">Beverage of choice</h3>
<p>Coffee is a magical drink of choice. Its ever-increasing popularity can be attributed to its versatility and of course <strong>Caffeine</strong> the magic alkaloid that gives you bliss as you sip your coffee down.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The coffee plant originated in Africa</li>
  <li>Two different variety of Coffee:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arabica</strong>: The more popular and expensive variety, this is considered to be milder and more flavourful. The bean is flatter and elongated and requires a cool sub-tropical climate.  Typically grows around the elevation ranging from 2000 - 6500 ft where it needs sun, moisture and shade. Largest producers of Arabica are <strong>Latin America</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong>, <strong>Arabia</strong> and <strong>East Africa</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Robusta</strong>: This is cheaper to produce but has almost twice the quantity of caffeine than the <strong>Arabica</strong> coffee. Robusta beans are rounder and can grow at lower altitudes (sea level - 2000 ft.). <strong>Central and Western Africa</strong>, <strong>South East Asia</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong> are the leading producers of Robusta.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history-of-coffee">History of Coffee</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Coffee plants grew in the wild in the area called Kefa or Kaffa in Ethiopia. These plants were taken to Arabia and cultivated around the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li>Legend is attributed to a goatherd by the name <strong>Kaldi</strong> who noticed that his heard started behaving weirdly after eating certain berries. He tasted them and felt ecstatic as well. He made coffee popular according to the legend.</li>
  <li>Since it was an intoxicating drink, Islam forbade drinking coffee since such drinks are prohibited by Quran.</li>
  <li>Despite the risk, coffee lovers grew in leaps and bounds within Arabia and drink became popular.</li>
  <li>This paved way for the creation of “Coffeehouses” called <strong>Qahveh Khanehs</strong> and gave rise to the coffee house culture. They first appeared in Mecca around the 15<sup>th</sup> century and were popular places to catch up with friends.</li>
  <li>Coffee came to Europe around 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries and spread across Europe.</li>
  <li>Some countries prohibited coffee stating they are magical potions.</li>
  <li>Coffee houses became popular in Britain and British colonies by 17<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  <li><strong>Yemen</strong> was almost the only supplier of coffee until the close of 17<sup>th</sup> century. But the popularity of the beverage took it all the way to <strong>Java</strong> in Indonesia and Americas along with Hawaii (since 1825).</li>
  <li>By 20th century Brazil became a leading producer and exporter of Coffee.</li>
  <li>In 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, coffee machines came into existence and various new methods of producing coffee came into being.</li>
  <li>Instant coffee came into popularity and production was perfected post-1950 leading to the increased production of Robusta.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="caffeine---the-magical-ingredient">Caffeine - the magical ingredient</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Caffeine is an alkaloid which is present in coffee, tea, cocoa and in some other nuts and berries.</li>
  <li>It normally is a white powder highly soluble in hot water.</li>
  <li>Caffeine stimulates central nervous system, heart and kidneys. It is also a mild diuretic (removes urine).</li>
  <li>Used as an antidote to respiratory depression caused by overdose.</li>
  <li>Negative effects: Insomnia, anxiety, irritation etc.</li>
  <li>Positive effects: Increased alertness and improved motor performance.</li>
  <li>Decaffeinated coffee became popular to control the amount of coffee in the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="production-of-coffee">Production of coffee</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee cherries contain coffee beans, usually two. Single beaned berries are called <strong>pea beans</strong> and are said to be sweeter and flavourful.</li>
  <li>Beans are separated from the berries and the dried to reduce the moisture content from 65-70% down to 12-13%.</li>
  <li>Three techniques are used for processing coffee:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dry method</strong>: In this process, the berries are placed under the sun on concrete or brick patios. This is the simplest way of processing and is least expensive. Practised in areas with dry and warm climate like Ethiopia and Brazil. The berries are raked to move them around and to prevent fermentation. The process takes few days to around four weeks. Overdrying breaks the coffee and underlying causes fungi and other bacteria attack. Once dried, the coffee beans are separated by machinery.</li>
      <li><strong>Wet method</strong>: This method produces better quality coffee and requires much more sophisticated equipment than the dry method. The skin and the pulp are removed using a pulping machine that uses a rotating drum. The thin layer of pulp that still remains is removed by fermentation that happens over three days as the wet seeds are kept in tanks. Remaining pulp is washed off and the beans are dried under the sun or by passing hot air.</li>
      <li><strong>Pulped natural process</strong>: In this third way of processing, the pulp is removed mechanically but there is no intermediate fermentation and the remaining pulp is removed once the beans dry off. This is a combination of dry and wet techniques. The beans produced in this method are both sweet and acidic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Post the processing the coffee is graded and stored.</p>

<h3 id="roasting-and-grinding">Roasting and Grinding</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee beans are roasted between 180-250 °C from 7-20 mins releasing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water.</li>
  <li>The beans lose weight and expand under the roasting process.</li>
  <li>Roasting gives the aroma to the coffee.</li>
  <li>Overroasting kills the flavour which is done in the case of Robusta beans to remove the strong coffee flavour.</li>
  <li>The old method was to roast coffee beans in a rotating metal cylinder above a source of heat. Modern method uses hot air to roast the beans. Rotation ensures even roasting.</li>
  <li>Grinding is either done before packaging or done by the consumer depending on the brew method involved. We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" target="_blank">French Press</a>, hence coarsely ground coffee is what purchase.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="packaging-and-brewing">Packaging and Brewing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee needs to be sealed airtight to prevent moisture from reaching it.</li>
  <li>Modern methods use inert gas and aluminium or polyethene compounds.</li>
  <li>Different methods of brewing:
    <ul>
      <li>French Press</li>
      <li>Pour over</li>
      <li>Moka Pot</li>
      <li>Aeropress</li>
      <li>Cold brewing</li>
      <li>Espresso</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instant coffee is a soluble coffee concentrate which does not need to be brewed but the flavour is usually inferior to brewed coffee.</li>
  <li>Kopi Luwak (Civet coffee).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="decaf">Decaf</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For people who do not tolerate caffeine, it is removed from the coffee using chemical solvents, carbon filtering or carbon dioxide extraction. Caffeine is extracted just before roasting.</li>
  <li>The chemical agent is either used to treat the beans directly or the water-based solution in which the beans are soaked.</li>
  <li>Swiss water process is used to get more flavourful beans. The first batch of beans are processed in hot water and that water is used for washing the next bath of the beans.</li>
  <li>100% decaf is not a possibility.</li>
</ul>

				<itunes:subtitle>In this episode, we talk about continental drift</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h1 id="continental-drift">Continental Drift</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The idea first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596 and also by Francis Bacon in 1620 mostly due to the apparent similarities in the outlines of the continents. This was the period when maps were surfacing and gave a clearer view of continents.</li>
  <li>Alfred Wegener further developed it in 1912. Stated the continents are moving away from poles due to the bulge towards the equator. Though these forces exist, they are too weak to push the continental plates.</li>
  <li>Wagner suggested that continents once were together and then they started moving apart.</li>
  <li>Supercontinent was called Pangaea which meant entire Earth during the Permian period around 240 million years ago.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tharp-hezeen-map">Tharp-Hezeen Map</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 1977, Marie Tharp and Bruce Hazeen along with artist Heinrich Berann produced the first World Ocean Floor Panorama.</li>
  <li>Tharp worked out of Lamont Geological Observatory at Columbia University.</li>
  <li>Started using sonar pings to gather data from ocean floor since 1952 to map the ocean floor.</li>
  <li>Discovered the rift valley down the centre of Atlantic Ocean.</li>
  <li>The rift extended for more than 40,000 miles and was a proof for the theory of continental drift, which was unpopular in the US at the time.</li>
  <li>The existence of the rift confirmed in 1959 by Jacques Costeau in New York where he screened a film of the rift valley that he had filmed.</li>
  <li>Tharp’s hand-drawn diagrams encouraged scientists from US, UK, Canada and other nations to write papers on plate tectonics.</li>
  <li>NatGeo didn’t care about a project to bring all the maps together so they sought help from US Naval Research.</li>
  <li>Hazeen died in 1977 and rest of the mapping project was never completed.</li>
  <li>Only 10-15% of the entire ocean has been mapped and Tharp-Hazeen maps are still relevant.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>Could not explain what caused the drift.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plate-tectonics">Plate Tectonics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mid 1900s, built on Wegner’s theory</li>
  <li>The lithosphere is broken up into seven very large continental and ocean-sized plates, six or seven medium-sized regional plates, and several small ones. They move relative to each other.</li>
  <li>Plates float on asthenosphere beneath the Mantle which comes under the crust.</li>
  <li>Continental crust is made of Granite and is thicker and less denser about 2.7 g per cubic cm. Typically upto 40km thick.</li>
  <li>Oceanic crust is thin and dense made of Basalt.</li>
  <li>The crust sits on top of Mantle, very rich in Magnesium and iron bearing silicate minerals.</li>
  <li>Crust and Mantle make up lithosphere. This floats on asthenosphere.</li>
  <li>Asthenosphere moves due to convection.</li>
  <li>Boundary between crust and mantle is called Mohorovičić discontinuity or Moho after Andrija Mohorovičić. These are defined by seismic studies.</li>
  <li>Lithosphere includes crust and uppper mantle just below Moho.</li>
  <li>Heat below the surface causes mantle to lose its rigidity around 100km below the surface. This is the begining of Asthenosphere.</li>
  <li>At 2900km mantle gives way to outer core and at 5100km, inner core starts.</li>
  <li>Inner core is further divided into Outer-Inner Core (OIC) and Inner-Inner Core (IIC) distiguished by their North-South and East-West polarity of iron crystals respectively.</li>
  <li>Earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the region where plates meet, called fault lines.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-happens-at-the-plate-boundaries">What happens at the plate boundaries?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Divergent Margins:</strong> Plates moving apart at divergent plate boundary releases pressure which melts the Mantle underneath. Magma created as a result of this moves upwards and cools just below the surface creating new crust. Hence these are also called constructive margins.</li>
  <li><strong>Continental Rifting:</strong> Magma rising up causes  the lithosphere to stretch and lift up. This results in rift on the surface of continents. The rift continues until the crust become thin and a new ocean is formed. The rising magma cools down and since it is basalting, forms the basin for the new ocean.</li>
  <li><strong>Seafloor Spreading:</strong> As magma keeps rising, the sea floor starts to spread. New rocks are created on the ocean floor and hence the age of rocks on the seabed are much less than that found on continents.</li>
  <li><strong>Convegent Margin:</strong> Since Earth has a finite surface area, the creation of new crust is balanced out by destructive plate margins or Convergent Margins where the crust sinks into the mantle. When two plates meet, the older one usually subducts below the younger warmer plate. If the convergence happens between oceanic and continental plates, the continental plate being less denser and hence more bouyant, stays on top and the oceanic plate subducts beneath. This results on continental crusts being preserved and oceanic crust being regenerated every few million years. Hence the fossils of deep sea creatures are sometimes found on the surface of continents. When the collision happens between two continental plates, results in the creation of mountain ranges like the Himalayas which formed when the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate and eliminated the ocean in between.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Subduction Zones:</strong> Subduction happens when lithosphere of around 100km thickness decends into the mantle. This creates earthquake zones along the zone called the <strong>Wadati-Benioff</strong> zone. Places like Japan lie on these zones and are prone to earthquakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Transform boundary: plates slide against one another. Earthquakes happen here. San Andreas fault in California.</li>
  <li>Convergent boundaries: Plates collide.
    <ul>
      <li>Subduction zone: Continental crust collides with oceanic crust resulting in the sinking of oceaning crust beneath continental crust da ue to the higher density of oceanic crust and results in melting of the crust and forms active volcanoes. This results in earthquakes, volcanoes and deep trenches. Andes mountains.</li>
      <li>Island Arc: Oceanic crust with Oceanic crust. One of the crust sinks, normally the older rock. Results in volcanoes, trenches.</li>
      <li>Collision zone: Continental to continentalThe The . Himalayas.
  The - Island of Cyprus formed athe t boundary of African and Eurasian plates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Divergent boundaries: Plates move away from each other.
    <ul>
      <li>On land:  Rift zone, rock is ripped apart and normally found in the ocean and particularly in East Africa. Active volcanoes and minor earthquakes.</li>
      <li>Mid ocean: Creates alternating bands of magnetism because of change in Earth’s magentism which is a proof for divergance. Mid Atlantic ridge is an example.</li>
      <li>Iceland is geologically active mainly due to being on the divergent plates.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="continental-drift">Continental Drift</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The idea first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596 and also by Francis Bacon in 1620 mostly due to the apparent similarities in the outlines of the continents. This was the period when maps were surfacing and gave a clearer view of continents.</li>
  <li>Alfred Wegener further developed it in 1912. Stated the continents are moving away from poles due to the bulge towards the equator. Though these forces exist, they are too weak to push the continental plates.</li>
  <li>Wagner suggested that continents once were together and then they started moving apart.</li>
  <li>Supercontinent was called Pangaea which meant entire Earth during the Permian period around 240 million years ago.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tharp-hezeen-map">Tharp-Hezeen Map</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 1977, Marie Tharp and Bruce Hazeen along with artist Heinrich Berann produced the first World Ocean Floor Panorama.</li>
  <li>Tharp worked out of Lamont Geological Observatory at Columbia University.</li>
  <li>Started using sonar pings to gather data from ocean floor since 1952 to map the ocean floor.</li>
  <li>Discovered the rift valley down the centre of Atlantic Ocean.</li>
  <li>The rift extended for more than 40,000 miles and was a proof for the theory of continental drift, which was unpopular in the US at the time.</li>
  <li>The existence of the rift confirmed in 1959 by Jacques Costeau in New York where he screened a film of the rift valley that he had filmed.</li>
  <li>Tharp’s hand-drawn diagrams encouraged scientists from US, UK, Canada and other nations to write papers on plate tectonics.</li>
  <li>NatGeo didn’t care about a project to bring all the maps together so they sought help from US Naval Research.</li>
  <li>Hazeen died in 1977 and rest of the mapping project was never completed.</li>
  <li>Only 10-15% of the entire ocean has been mapped and Tharp-Hazeen maps are still relevant.</li>

<h2 id="plate-tectonics">Plate Tectonics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mid 1900s, built on Wegner’s theory</li>
  <li>The lithosphere is broken up into seven very large continental and ocean-sized plates, six or seven medium-sized regional plates, and several small ones. They move relative to each other.</li>
  <li>Plates float on asthenosphere beneath the Mantle which comes under the crust.</li>
  <li>Continental crust is made of Granite and is thicker and less denser about 2.7 g per cubic cm. Typically upto 40km thick.</li>
  <li>Oceanic crust is thin and dense made of Basalt.</li>
  <li>The crust sits on top of Mantle, very rich in Magnesium and iron bearing silicate minerals.</li>
  <li>Crust and Mantle make up lithosphere. This floats on asthenosphere.</li>
  <li>Asthenosphere moves due to convection.</li>
  <li>Boundary between crust and mantle is called Mohorovičić discontinuity or Moho after Andrija Mohorovičić. These are defined by seismic studies.</li>
  <li>Lithosphere includes crust and uppper mantle just below Moho.</li>
  <li>Heat below the surface causes mantle to lose its rigidity around 100km below the surface. This is the begining of Asthenosphere.</li>
  <li>At 2900km mantle gives way to outer core and at 5100km, inner core starts.</li>
  <li>Inner core is further divided into Outer-Inner Core (OIC) and Inner-Inner Core (IIC) distiguished by their North-South and East-West polarity of iron crystals respectively.</li>
  <li>Earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the region where plates meet, called fault lines.</li>

<h3 id="timeline-1">Timeline:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>15 June, 1910 - Terra Nova sailed from Cardiff, Wales</li>
  <li>Scott tied up with expedition business, joined Terra Nova in South Africa after catching a faster passenger liner</li>
  <li>Leaves the ship in Melbourne for further business, receives letter from Amundsen</li>
  <li>Rejoined the ship in New Zealand with additional supplies</li>
  <li>Met with heavy storms and loss of supplies in the Sea</li>
  <li>January 1911 - Built a base at Cape Evans (named after Scott’s second-in-command)</li>
  <li>Campbell’s Eastern party to explore King Edward VII Land, meets Amundsen’s party</li>
  <li>January 1911 - Start of Depot laying with the One Ton Depay laid 48 kilometers short of its intended location</li>
  <li>1911 winter - Hut was separated using packing cases for “officers” and “men”</li>
  <li>09 February, 1911 - Campbell’s party became the Northern party and set up camp at Robertson Bay (They could not carry out experiments as per the plan and returned to base came in September 1912)</li>
  <li>Wester Parties - Conducted two geological expeditions</li>
  <li>Journey to Cape Crozier in the winter to secure eggs of emperor penguin and to experiment with food rations and equipment before the polar journey</li>
  <li>13 September, 1911 - South polar journey plans revealed</li>
  <li>24 October, 1911 - The Motor Party left the base</li>
  <li>01 November, 1911 - Scott and his party left the base</li>
  <li>21 November, 1911 - Scott’s party caught up with the Motor party</li>
  <li>03 January, 1912 - Scott chose his party of five (instead of four) - Scott, Wilson, Oates, Bowers and Edgar Evans</li>
  <li>09 January, 1912 - Passed Shackleton’s furthest point</li>
  <li>16 January, 1912 - Saw Amundsen’s black flag</li>
  <li>17 January, 1912 - Reached South Pole (Scott’s entry - “The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected … Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here”)</li>
  <li>18 January, 1912 - Finds Amundsen’s tent, supplies and letter stating they had reached on 16 December, 1911</li>
  <li>Returning homewards - Edgar Evans suffering and Lawrence Oates severe frostbite</li>
  <li>17 February, 1912 - Edgar Evans dies due to head injuries, frostbite and a hand injury which failed to heal</li>
  <li>Reached the meet point, but could not find the dog teams, temperature dropped sharply, and the fuel supplies were meagre</li>
  <li>Low temperature and radiation caused poor surface to pull the sledge, lack of wind made the temperatures even worse, and Oates frostbite reduced the daily average of distance covered to three to five miles down from fifteen</li>
  <li>10 March, 1912 -  It became evident that the dog teams where not coming</li>
  <li>Oates sacrifices himself by walking out of his tent towards his death. Last words, “I am just going outside and may be some time.”</li>
  <li>20 March, 1912 - Reached 11 miles near to the One Ton Depot but a blizzard stopped them in their tracks</li>
  <li>29 March, 1912 - Presumed date of their death and Scott’s last entry - “Every day we have been ready to start for our depot 11 miles away, but outside the door of the tent it remains a scene of whirling drift. I do not think we can hope for any better things now. We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity but I do not think I can write more. R. Scott. Last entry. For God’s sake look after our people.”</li>
  <li>29 October 1912 - Search party sent to find Scott</li>
  <li>12 November 1912 - The tent containing Scott, Wilson, and Bowers found 11 miles south of One Ton Depot</li>
  <li>10 February, 1913 - Edward Atkinson and Lieutenant Harry Pennell reached the ports of New Zealand and relayed a message about the fate of Scott’s party.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scott hailed a tragic hero which overshadowed Amundsen’s achievements</li>
  <li>Critics questioned the leadership abilities of Scott</li>
  <li>The fate of the group said to be the result of many “ifs” with the weather playing the major part</li>

<h3 id="timeline-1">Timeline:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>15 June, 1910 - Terra Nova sailed from Cardiff, Wales</li>
  <li>Scott tied up with expedition business, joined Terra Nova in South Africa after catching a faster passenger liner</li>
  <li>Leaves the ship in Melbourne for further business, receives letter from Amundsen</li>
  <li>Rejoined the ship in New Zealand with additional supplies</li>
  <li>Met with heavy storms and loss of supplies in the Sea</li>
  <li>January 1911 - Built a base at Cape Evans (named after Scott’s second-in-command)</li>
  <li>Campbell’s Eastern party to explore King Edward VII Land, meets Amundsen’s party</li>
  <li>January 1911 - Start of Depot laying with the One Ton Depay laid 48 kilometers short of its intended location</li>
  <li>1911 winter - Hut was separated using packing cases for “officers” and “men”</li>
  <li>09 February, 1911 - Campbell’s party became the Northern party and set up camp at Robertson Bay (They could not carry out experiments as per the plan and returned to base came in September 1912)</li>
  <li>Wester Parties - Conducted two geological expeditions</li>
  <li>Journey to Cape Crozier in the winter to secure eggs of emperor penguin and to experiment with food rations and equipment before the polar journey</li>
  <li>13 September, 1911 - South polar journey plans revealed</li>
  <li>24 October, 1911 - The Motor Party left the base</li>
  <li>01 November, 1911 - Scott and his party left the base</li>
  <li>21 November, 1911 - Scott’s party caught up with the Motor party</li>
  <li>03 January, 1912 - Scott chose his party of five (instead of four) - Scott, Wilson, Oates, Bowers and Edgar Evans</li>
  <li>09 January, 1912 - Passed Shackleton’s furthest point</li>
  <li>16 January, 1912 - Saw Amundsen’s black flag</li>
  <li>17 January, 1912 - Reached South Pole (Scott’s entry - “The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected … Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here”)</li>
  <li>18 January, 1912 - Finds Amundsen’s tent, supplies and letter stating they had reached on 16 December, 1911</li>
  <li>Returning homewards - Edgar Evans suffering and Lawrence Oates severe frostbite</li>
  <li>17 February, 1912 - Edgar Evans dies due to head injuries, frostbite and a hand injury which failed to heal</li>
  <li>Reached the meet point, but could not find the dog teams, temperature dropped sharply, and the fuel supplies were meagre</li>
  <li>Low temperature and radiation caused poor surface to pull the sledge, lack of wind made the temperatures even worse, and Oates frostbite reduced the daily average of distance covered to three to five miles down from fifteen</li>
  <li>10 March, 1912 -  It became evident that the dog teams where not coming</li>
  <li>Oates sacrifices himself by walking out of his tent towards his death. Last words, “I am just going outside and may be some time.”</li>
  <li>20 March, 1912 - Reached 11 miles near to the One Ton Depot but a blizzard stopped them in their tracks</li>
  <li>29 March, 1912 - Presumed date of their death and Scott’s last entry - “Every day we have been ready to start for our depot 11 miles away, but outside the door of the tent it remains a scene of whirling drift. I do not think we can hope for any better things now. We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity but I do not think I can write more. R. Scott. Last entry. For God’s sake look after our people.”</li>
  <li>29 October 1912 - Search party sent to find Scott</li>
  <li>12 November 1912 - The tent containing Scott, Wilson, and Bowers found 11 miles south of One Ton Depot</li>
  <li>10 February, 1913 - Edward Atkinson and Lieutenant Harry Pennell reached the ports of New Zealand and relayed a message about the fate of Scott’s party.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scott hailed a tragic hero which overshadowed Amundsen’s achievements</li>
  <li>Critics questioned the leadership abilities of Scott</li>
  <li>The fate of the group said to be the result of many “ifs” with the weather playing the major part</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Asterisk (*) next to names means those who reached the South Pole</li>
  <li>Amundsen received help at Argentina from Peter “Don Pedro” Christophersen, a Norwegian expatriate whose brother was Norway’s Minister in Buenos Aires</li>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-blockchain-funda">The Blockchain Funda</h1>
<ul>
  <li>According to Hubspot research, one of the most confusing emerging technology.</li>
  <li>Blockchain is a digital method of economic transaction record-keeping – also known as a ledger.</li>
  <li>Security keeps it differentiated from other technologies. Records are kept open within a network but no one can edit or delete.</li>
  <li>It is like a database that can be updated only through solving a complex mathematical problem.</li>
  <li>The chain is linked through <em>hash</em> from the previous block and the chain continues to the hash from the <em>genesis block</em> which happens to be the first block in the entire chain.</li>
  <li>Designed to be resistant to modification especially backdating or other tampering with the timestamps and other details in a financial transaction.</li>
  <li>Latest fad in the tech industry.</li>
  <li>Described back in 1991 to timestamp digital documents.</li>
  <li>Used in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto to create cryptocurrency called <em>Bitcoin</em>.</li>
  <li>Each block contains data, hash of the block and the hash of the previous block.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On 9 Jan, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto announced the release of bitcoin as a peer to peer, completely de-centralised network with no server or central authority.</li>
  <li>The idea was to eliminate any middle-man agents like banks or other agencies in the digital transactions.</li>
  <li>In a centralised network, the server keeps a record of all the transactions and validates them. In a decentralised network, every entity on the network does the job of comparing and then validating the authenticity of the transaction.</li>
  <li>Every peer keeps a list of the transactions to ensure all the future transactions are valid.</li>
  <li>Basically cryptocurrency is an entry in a database which can be changed only under specific conditions. Which is true in case of a bank transaction as well.</li>
  <li>Cryptocurrency usually consists of a network of peers and every peer has a complete history of all transactions ever happened and hence the balance of every account.</li>
  <li>A transaction file is signed by individual private key and published in the network. The authenticity of the transaction is confirmed by miners.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin file size grew to 20GB in 2014 and is currently over 100GB in size.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="miners">Miners:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Miners confirm the legitimacy of the transactions and broadcast that to the network. Once a miner confirms, the transaction gets added to the blockchain in all the peers.</li>
  <li>Miners get paid back in the cryptocurrency for this. In case of Bitcoin, the miners earn a specific amount of Bitcoin for validating a transaction.</li>
  <li>To be a miner, some amount of computing power has to be invested into finding the hash to connect the block to the chain.</li>
  <li>Miners compete to solve a series of cryptographic puzzles and as a reward, they are allowed to add a transaction to the coinbase which is the valid way of creating bitcoins.</li>
  <li>Bitcoins are created only when miners solve a puzzle. The difficulty of puzzle increases the computing power required to solve the puzzle and this results in only a specific amount of currency being created in a given amount of time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mining">Mining</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin mining requires a computer and a special software. Miners use the computing power of their systems to compete with other miners to solve a series of complex puzzles.</li>
  <li>Every ten minutes, miners try to solve a block that has the latest transaction data in it using cryptographic hash functions.</li>
  <li>Computer warehouses have been set up to create a business out of bitcoin mining.</li>
  <li>There is a minimum difficulty level set for the hash for the miners to solve. If the incoming hash does not qualify for that level of difficulty, an arbitrary string called nonce is added to the hash and the new string is re-hashed to create a new hash and this new hash is compared to see if it conforms to the difficulty level expected. If not, the nonce is changed and the process is repeated until the required difficulty is attained.</li>
  <li>Once required difficulty is attained, block it added to the blockchain and the ledger is updated. The miners are then rewarded using Bitcoins.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-cryptocurrency">Why cryptocurrency:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Irreversible</strong>: Once a transaction is made, it is irreversible by anyone. There is no way you can dispute a transaction and get the money back.</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymous</strong>: Transactions and accounts are not usually connected to real-world entities. Transaction flow can be analysed by not necessarily the identity of the users.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong>: The transactions are almost instantaneous irrespective of the location of the users.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: Since cryptography is extensively used in cryptocurrency, it is secure. Cryptocurrency can be sent only using the owners private key.</li>
  <li><strong>No middle-man</strong>: No permission is required to use cryptocurrency. There is no middle-man. Anyone can send or receive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hash">Hash</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hash is a method of taking an input string and encoding it to and output of fixed length. A hashing algorithm is used for this conversion. In case of Bitcoin, SHA-256 is used for hashing.</li>
  <li>The fixed length of output helps in saving data that might otherwise be of considerable size.</li>
  <li>Hashes remain the same irrespective of the number of times the data is passed through the algorithm.</li>
  <li>Hashes cannot be converted back to its inputs but can be identified by comparing the data after hashing the possible values again.</li>
  <li>Brute forcing becomes virtually impossible due to the sheer number of tries that is required. For a 128 bit hash, it will take anywhere between 1 and 2<sup>128-1</sup> tries. That means an average of 2<sup>127</sup> tries which is a huge number.</li>
  <li>Any change in the input will reflect in the hash.</li>
  <li>Collision resistance determines the chances of two different inputs producing the same hash. MD5’s (128-bit hash) collision resistance was broken after 2<sup>21</sup> hashes and SHA 1 (160-bit hash) was broken after 2<sup>61</sup> hashes. SHA 256 is used by bitcoin and Keccak 256 is produced by Etherium.</li>
  <li>The blockchain is a linked list of data and it’s associated hash pointer which points to the hash of the previous block and hence forming a block.</li>
  <li>So if an intruder changes data, the resulting hash changes drastically and will no longer have its pointer point to the previous block. This way the blockchain remain immutable (unchangeable).</li>

				<itunes:subtitle>We talk about submarines, the coolest way to travel!</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h2 id="submarines">Submarines</h2>
<h3 id="what-a-submarine-is">What a submarine is:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is an underwater vehicle used mostly for military purpose in the current day and age. Civilian uses mostly for science (marine biology)</li>
  <li>Cylindrical in shape with conical edges.</li>
  <li>Bridge structure called <em>Fin</em> in Europe and <em>Sail</em> in America. Houses periscope and stuff.</li>
  <li>Powered by a propeller or pump jet and has fins on the rear to control the level of the submarine. Along with this also uses ballast tanks which are filled with compressed air to ‘surface’ the craft or filled with water to sink it.</li>
  <li>Nuclear and Diesel powered: Diesel powered subs require air for the combustion of Diesel engines while nuclear submarines used nuclear energy. This enabled them to remain submerged for a much longer duration under water. Modern-day submarines can stay submerged for over 6 months.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Development started before WWI but accelerated during the war.</li>
  <li>Leonardo da Vinci had drawings of a submarine but never materialised into a real craft. It was called a ship to sink another ship. He never revealed it public to prevent wars from turning more deadly than they already are.</li>
  <li>Seems like Greeks had mastered the craft back in the 1500s during the reign of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. A couple of guys emerged dry from underwater in river <strong>Tagus</strong> near the city of <strong>Toledo</strong> in Spain.</li>
  <li><strong>William Bourne</strong>, an English mathematician, mentioned in his book about an underwater navigation device. <strong>John Napier</strong>, Scottish mathematician also mentioned an invention which stayed underwater with divers and could also be used in warfare.</li>
  <li>The first real submarine that was built was done in 1620 by <strong>Cornelis Drebbel</strong>, a Dutchman who worked for King James I of England. It used oars for propulsion.</li>
  <li>Interest in submarines went up during the 18th century and there were patents coming up for submarines.</li>
  <li>Ballast tank idea was patented in 1747 by <strong>Nathaniel Symons</strong> using leather bags filled with water. There was a mechanism to remove water from the bags and re-surface the craft. <strong>Giovanni Borelli</strong> had proposed a similar design earlier.</li>
  <li>The first use of a submarine in combat was built in 1775 by <strong>David Bushnell</strong> and was called <strong>Turtle</strong>. This was used during the American Revolutionary War for attaching explosives to British Navy vessels anchored in the New York harbour. Although the various attempts at attaching explosives failed, it sparked an interest in using submarines for warfare.</li>
  <li>Propulsion of the <strong>Turtle</strong> was done using hand crank and this meant that the pilot needed to have a great stamina to keep the craft steady. The direction was controlled by a lever that controlled the rudder in the rear of the craft.</li>
  <li>The first non-human powered submarine was Plongeur launched in 1963 invented by the French and used compressed air.</li>
  <li><strong>Narcis Monturiol</strong> launched the first combustion-powered submarine Incitnio II in Barcelona in 1864.</li>
  <li>Submarines became effective with the invention of the torpedo by <strong>Robert Whitehead</strong> in 1866.</li>
  <li>English inventor <strong>George Garrett</strong> and Swedish industrialist <strong>Thorsten Nordenfelt</strong> built the first steam submarine capable of firing torpedoes called the Nordenfelt I and had a range of 240 km.</li>
  <li>Irish inventor <strong>John Philip Holland</strong> built the Holland Type IV submarine in 1896 which was hybrid using internal combustion engine while on the surface and electric engine while submerged. This class submarine was purchased by US Navy and was used in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905 as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="world-war-and-the-progress-made">World war and the progress made</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The development of submarine was accelerated during the world war times where naval warfare was as important as land or air warfare.</li>
  <li>U-boats of Germany proved to be deadly in the war.</li>
  <li>During the beginning of the war, both England and Germany had submarines though British had significantly more submarines than Germany.</li>
  <li>Diesel engined U-boats could have a range of 5000 miles and speed of 15 km/h</li>
  <li>During WWI U boats sank over 5000 ships.</li>
  <li>During WW2, U boats wrecked British shipping routes.</li>
  <li>The US wrecked havoc over capable Japanese Navy.</li>
  <li>Pakistani submarine sank INS Khukri, in turn, India sank Ghazi (loaned from the US) submarine of Pakistan.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workings">Workings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A submarine has a cigar-shaped hull. This shape helps in drastically reducing the water resistance around the body of the sub.</li>
  <li>The sail or the fin might also have a bridge on top which is used for observational purposes.</li>
  <li>Propulsion was carried out by humans in the early type of submarines. Before nuclear power was invented, submarines were powered by combustion engines on the surface and electric engines while being submerged.</li>
  <li>Earlier crafts used petrol and the later ones started using diesel-electric engines for reduced flammability and increased efficiency. This also meant the batteries could be charged by running the submarine on diesel engines for some time.</li>
  <li>Germans tried using a snorkel that could supply oxygen to the engines while being at periscope depth but not without problems of visible exhaust and speed constraints to prevent snorkel from breaking off.</li>
  <li>During WWII, submarines designed to carry hydrogen peroxide as oxidisers were built by Germany. Due to limited success, these later carried large batteries instead.</li>
  <li>Nuclear energy powers larger submarines in the present day. Nuclear power is used to drive turbines that power the propeller. A disadvantage is the noise generated by coolant pumps whereas a diesel-electric can run on batteries almost quietly.</li>
  <li>Ships float over water due to a buoyant force that acts on it. For a submarine to sink below the surface. For this, modern-day submarines use <em>ballast tanks</em> which hold varying amount of water and air.</li>
  <li>Apart from using compressed air, submarine also uses tailplanes to move it up and down. There are such planes connected to the Fin (Sail) and body as well.</li>
  <li>Forward and <strong>Main Ballast Tanks</strong> are filled with water to submerge or is filled with air to surface the craft. <strong>Depth Control Tanks</strong> were used for precise adjustments to the depth. In case of emergency surfacing or submerging, these tanks are used along with these tailplanes simultaneously. But this quick move can make the submarine partially jump from the water as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="navigation-and-communication">Navigation and communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Submarines use SONAR sensors that rely on reflected sounds to detect objects. They are located within the hull and sometimes also towed behind the submarine.</li>
  <li>Modern submarines use internal guidance systems and depend on global positioning system (GPS) to tackle error in the internal systems. Periscope is used sparingly for short-range observations.</li>
  <li>Communication is carried out using low-frequency radio and in short bursts ost of the time to avoid detection.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="life-support">Life support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Since a modern submarine stays submerged for months at a time, oxygen for the crew cannot always be pulled in from the atmosphere. In normal cases, electrolysis of water is used to generate oxygen necessary for the crew to breath.</li>
  <li>Carbon Dioxide scrubber is used for removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the submarine atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Freshwater is produced by using <strong>reverse osmosis method</strong> which is a method of removing ions, molecules and larger particles by using a semi-permeable material.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crew">Crew</h3>
<ul>
  <li>About 80 members in a typical craft.</li>
  <li>Difficult conditions &amp; maintain radio silence.</li>
  <li>Women were allowed only as late as 1985 (Starting with Royal Norwegian Army)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="indian-submarines">Indian Submarines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chakra Class: This is an attack submarine which is under a 10-year lease from Russia since 12 years.</li>
  <li>Arihant Class: Ballistic missile submarine which was commissioned in 2016.</li>
  <li>Apart from these, there are 14 diesel-electric submarines in use currently.</li>
  <li>Kalvari Class (diesel-electric): Attack submarine currently undergoing sea trials.</li>

<h3 id="what-a-submarine-is">What a submarine is:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is an underwater vehicle used mostly for military purpose in the current day and age. Civilian uses mostly for science (marine biology)</li>
  <li>Cylindrical in shape with conical edges.</li>
  <li>Bridge structure called <em>Fin</em> in Europe and <em>Sail</em> in America. Houses periscope and stuff.</li>
  <li>Powered by a propeller or pump jet and has fins on the rear to control the level of the submarine. Along with this also uses ballast tanks which are filled with compressed air to ‘surface’ the craft or filled with water to sink it.</li>
  <li>Nuclear and Diesel powered: Diesel powered subs require air for the combustion of Diesel engines while nuclear submarines used nuclear energy. This enabled them to remain submerged for a much longer duration under water. Modern-day submarines can stay submerged for over 6 months.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Development started before WWI but accelerated during the war.</li>
  <li>Leonardo da Vinci had drawings of a submarine but never materialised into a real craft. It was called a ship to sink another ship. He never revealed it public to prevent wars from turning more deadly than they already are.</li>
  <li>Seems like Greeks had mastered the craft back in the 1500s during the reign of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. A couple of guys emerged dry from underwater in river <strong>Tagus</strong> near the city of <strong>Toledo</strong> in Spain.</li>
  <li><strong>William Bourne</strong>, an English mathematician, mentioned in his book about an underwater navigation device. <strong>John Napier</strong>, Scottish mathematician also mentioned an invention which stayed underwater with divers and could also be used in warfare.</li>
  <li>The first real submarine that was built was done in 1620 by <strong>Cornelis Drebbel</strong>, a Dutchman who worked for King James I of England. It used oars for propulsion.</li>
  <li>Interest in submarines went up during the 18th century and there were patents coming up for submarines.</li>
  <li>Ballast tank idea was patented in 1747 by <strong>Nathaniel Symons</strong> using leather bags filled with water. There was a mechanism to remove water from the bags and re-surface the craft. <strong>Giovanni Borelli</strong> had proposed a similar design earlier.</li>
  <li>The first use of a submarine in combat was built in 1775 by <strong>David Bushnell</strong> and was called <strong>Turtle</strong>. This was used during the American Revolutionary War for attaching explosives to British Navy vessels anchored in the New York harbour. Although the various attempts at attaching explosives failed, it sparked an interest in using submarines for warfare.</li>
  <li>Propulsion of the <strong>Turtle</strong> was done using hand crank and this meant that the pilot needed to have a great stamina to keep the craft steady. The direction was controlled by a lever that controlled the rudder in the rear of the craft.</li>
  <li>The first non-human powered submarine was Plongeur launched in 1963 invented by the French and used compressed air.</li>
  <li><strong>Narcis Monturiol</strong> launched the first combustion-powered submarine Incitnio II in Barcelona in 1864.</li>
  <li>Submarines became effective with the invention of the torpedo by <strong>Robert Whitehead</strong> in 1866.</li>
  <li>English inventor <strong>George Garrett</strong> and Swedish industrialist <strong>Thorsten Nordenfelt</strong> built the first steam submarine capable of firing torpedoes called the Nordenfelt I and had a range of 240 km.</li>
  <li>Irish inventor <strong>John Philip Holland</strong> built the Holland Type IV submarine in 1896 which was hybrid using internal combustion engine while on the surface and electric engine while submerged. This class submarine was purchased by US Navy and was used in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905 as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="world-war-and-the-progress-made">World war and the progress made</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The development of submarine was accelerated during the world war times where naval warfare was as important as land or air warfare.</li>
  <li>U-boats of Germany proved to be deadly in the war.</li>
  <li>During the beginning of the war, both England and Germany had submarines though British had significantly more submarines than Germany.</li>
  <li>Diesel engined U-boats could have a range of 5000 miles and speed of 15 km/h</li>
  <li>During WWI U boats sank over 5000 ships.</li>
  <li>During WW2, U boats wrecked British shipping routes.</li>
  <li>The US wrecked havoc over capable Japanese Navy.</li>
  <li>Pakistani submarine sank INS Khukri, in turn, India sank Ghazi (loaned from the US) submarine of Pakistan.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workings">Workings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A submarine has a cigar-shaped hull. This shape helps in drastically reducing the water resistance around the body of the sub.</li>
  <li>The sail or the fin might also have a bridge on top which is used for observational purposes.</li>
  <li>Propulsion was carried out by humans in the early type of submarines. Before nuclear power was invented, submarines were powered by combustion engines on the surface and electric engines while being submerged.</li>
  <li>Earlier crafts used petrol and the later ones started using diesel-electric engines for reduced flammability and increased efficiency. This also meant the batteries could be charged by running the submarine on diesel engines for some time.</li>
  <li>Germans tried using a snorkel that could supply oxygen to the engines while being at periscope depth but not without problems of visible exhaust and speed constraints to prevent snorkel from breaking off.</li>
  <li>During WWII, submarines designed to carry hydrogen peroxide as oxidisers were built by Germany. Due to limited success, these later carried large batteries instead.</li>
  <li>Nuclear energy powers larger submarines in the present day. Nuclear power is used to drive turbines that power the propeller. A disadvantage is the noise generated by coolant pumps whereas a diesel-electric can run on batteries almost quietly.</li>
  <li>Ships float over water due to a buoyant force that acts on it. For a submarine to sink below the surface. For this, modern-day submarines use <em>ballast tanks</em> which hold varying amount of water and air.</li>
  <li>Apart from using compressed air, submarine also uses tailplanes to move it up and down. There are such planes connected to the Fin (Sail) and body as well.</li>
  <li>Forward and <strong>Main Ballast Tanks</strong> are filled with water to submerge or is filled with air to surface the craft. <strong>Depth Control Tanks</strong> were used for precise adjustments to the depth. In case of emergency surfacing or submerging, these tanks are used along with these tailplanes simultaneously. But this quick move can make the submarine partially jump from the water as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="navigation-and-communication">Navigation and communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Submarines use SONAR sensors that rely on reflected sounds to detect objects. They are located within the hull and sometimes also towed behind the submarine.</li>
  <li>Modern submarines use internal guidance systems and depend on global positioning system (GPS) to tackle error in the internal systems. Periscope is used sparingly for short-range observations.</li>
  <li>Communication is carried out using low-frequency radio and in short bursts ost of the time to avoid detection.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="life-support">Life support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Since a modern submarine stays submerged for months at a time, oxygen for the crew cannot always be pulled in from the atmosphere. In normal cases, electrolysis of water is used to generate oxygen necessary for the crew to breath.</li>
  <li>Carbon Dioxide scrubber is used for removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the submarine atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Freshwater is produced by using <strong>reverse osmosis method</strong> which is a method of removing ions, molecules and larger particles by using a semi-permeable material.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crew">Crew</h3>
<ul>
  <li>About 80 members in a typical craft.</li>
  <li>Difficult conditions &amp; maintain radio silence.</li>
  <li>Women were allowed only as late as 1985 (Starting with Royal Norwegian Army)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="indian-submarines">Indian Submarines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chakra Class: This is an attack submarine which is under a 10-year lease from Russia since 12 years.</li>
  <li>Arihant Class: Ballistic missile submarine which was commissioned in 2016.</li>
  <li>Apart from these, there are 14 diesel-electric submarines in use currently.</li>
  <li>Kalvari Class (diesel-electric): Attack submarine currently undergoing sea trials.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submarines are awesome!</p>

<h3 id="the-night-stalker">The Night Stalker</h3>
<p>Richard Ramirez was a serial killer nicknamed <em>The Night Stalker</em> who terrorized LA area in the 1980s. He was convicted and sentenced to death for 13 murders, 11 sexual assaults, 14 burglaries and 5 attempted murders.</p>

<h3 id="in-shankars-words">In Shankar’s words:</h3>

<p>The first time I heard about Richard Ramirez was in 2007. My school library had this book on serial killers which I happened to take home for a week. It detailed the antics of serial killers such as Ted Bundy (of course), BTK, Gary Ridgeway, Jack the Ripper, and more.</p>

<p>The fact that the book got through the censorship of the school escapes me. As a parent, I would not want my kid to read a book as such at the age of 16. But as a kid, though it was gruesome, I kind of enjoyed reading about these people who murdered and raped mercilessly.</p>

<p>I had already read about Ted Bundy, BTK, and most of the other well known serial killers from the Ann Rule article in the Reader’s Digest. So, reading about them in this book just refreshed my memories.</p>

<p>But Ramirez was someone I had never heard about. His story caught my attention. A tall, dark, Hispanic man who went on raping, killing, and stealing from everywhere for the kicks and to feed his addiction. He was convicted for 13 counts of murder, 11 counts of sexual assault, 14 counts of burglary, and 5 counts of attempted murder.</p>

<p>But how did he end up there? What were the reasons which lead him to commit such heinous crimes? Let us dig deep.</p>

<h3 id="modus-operandi">Modus Operandi</h3>
<p>He did not have a particular motive most of the time. He attacked and killed the men first. Sexually assaulted the women and brutally killed them. One motive was to grab hold of valuables to fuel his substance abuse.</p>

<h3 id="family-and-childhood">Family and Childhood</h3>
<p>Born in El Paso, Texas, on 29 February 1960, he was the youngest in the family of five children. He had two brothers with disabilities and a sister. He had a Catholic upbringing attending church and services on a regular basis. His father was a former policeman and was abusive in the way he treated his children.</p>

<p>His mother worked in a factory. She kept breathing in the harmful fumes produced by the factory, day in and day out. This is attributed to her two children being born with disabilities. Richard was born without any disabilities. He used to protect his brothers from bullying in school. He had a good name and was popular among the girls in school.</p>

<p>Writing can be a daunting task. It can be extremely time-consuming. Or sometimes it becomes hard to put your ideas on paper. Over the course of our journey as a writers, We have come across various tools which helped us write better. And here, We are going to share some of it with you.</p>

<h4 id="1-grammarly">1. Grammarly</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:11:58">11:58</a>} <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="blank">Grammarly</a> is among one of the best writing tools out there. It checks the spellings and grammar, with the ability to switch from American and British English. It also comes with an extension which you can add to your browser which is quite handy while framing emails or commenting on someones Facebook status. Saves you from the embarrassment of spelling and grammar mistakes. The paid version has a lot more features such as proofreading, plagiarism checker, vocabulary enhancement, and a lot more. But yeah, it costs around $11/month. One of the downside is Grammarly is not available on phones or tablet devices. You need to have a computer or laptop at your disposal to use it.</p>

<h4 id="2-hemmingway-app">2. Hemmingway App</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:12">13:12</a>} If like an Indian, you need things for free, look for another tool called <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="blank">Hemmingway App</a>. It is an app which “makes your writing Bold and Clear.” The thing cool about this tool is that it checks the readability and identifies adverbs, passive voices, simpler alternatives for words, hard and very hard sentences. The whole process of proofreading becomes so much easier.</p>

<h4 id="3-small-seo-tools-plagiarism-checker">3. Small SEO Tools Plagiarism Checker</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:16:02">16:02</a>} As the plagiarism checker comes under the premium plan of Grammarly, we use <a href="https://smallseotools.com/plagiarism-checker/" target="blank">Small SEO Tools Plagiarism Checker</a>. It is as effective as Grammarly and helps you find out anything which is remotely plagiarised. Simple to use and easy to identify.</p>

<h4 id="4-microsoft-onedrive">4. Microsoft OneDrive</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:17:32">17:32</a>} The Microsoft Word helps you transfer and share files by the use of <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="blank">OneDrive</a>. You also get to store these files without wasting any space on my computer. So, when I am working remotely or do not have access to a computer, I use OneDrive to share the files with my clients.
Google Drive is an alternative for you to store important files online. But OneDrive is integrated with Microsoft Word, which make the storage and sharing process a lot easier.</p>

<h4 id="5-celtx">5. Celtx</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:18:37">18:37</a>} <a href="https://www.celtx.com/index.html" target="blank">Celtx</a> is a tool used for script writing. The ease to use, the ability to switch from scene to scene, the transition, writing dialogues, everything becomes so easy with Celtx.</p>

<h4 id="6-pixabay">6. Pixabay</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:20:14">20:14</a>} <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="blank">Pixabay</a> is not so much of a tool, but it is a website where you can source royalty free images. I have been using the images from this website for almost all my blog posts. You can even edit the stock pictures to personalise for your use. You do not need any permission or licensing. Makes life a lot simpler.</p>

<h4 id="7-canva">7. Canva</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:22:26">22:26</a>} Sometimes the stock images sourced from Pixabay or any other royalty free image website might not suit in itself to be a blog post image. This calls for a bit of editing which can be done with <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="blank">Canva</a>. It is one of the best editing tools that can be used online. You get the ability to make Facebook, Instagram, Twitter posts with ease using this handy tool. You will also find stock images on Canva which you can use for free.</p>

<h4 id="8-inkscape">8. Inkscape</h4>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:25:27">25:27</a>} A logo plays an important part in the marketing aspect of any business. <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/release/0.92.2/" target="blank">Inkscape</a> is an amazing and easy to use tool for creating logos and manipulate with the existing pictures and turn them into vectors. It is easy to learn and if you have any plans to get into logo making you should check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEQXp_fcqwPcqrzNtWJ1w9w" target="blank">Nick Saporito’s Inkscape tutorials</a>. He explains it in detail and with complete correctness. Do go check his channel out.</p>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-happened-to-our-neanderthal-cousins">What happened to our neanderthal cousins?</h3>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:00:00">00:00</a>} Contrary to popular belief, Columbus did not actually discover America. Almost 500 years before Columbus, Lief Ericsson, a Viking, landed on the coast of Newfoundland. But even he wasn’t the first to reach Americas. Native Americans had already migrated to this region thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:02:50">02:50</a>} We discovered the existence of Neanderthals in 1856 when quarrymen found the fossils of human-like species in the Neander Valley in Germany. In the 1820s, a skull was discovered which belonged to a neanderthal girl. But this discovery did not get much attention.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:04:28">04:28</a>} Neanderthals lived in caves which were intricate in design with many passages and were dark. Everything happened inside these caves, everything! They had a social life where the young took care of the old. After death, the buried the corpse and they were very interested in making jewellery, paintings and carvings.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:32">06:32</a>} The biological characteristics of Neanderthals were different from human beings to adapt to the cold climate of Europe. They had a stockier body with muscle mass and were shorter than modern humans. They had to adapt to the severe cold of the ice age as well. They weren’t as athletic as human beings. Once they settled down in Europe, they did not move around much. They had a larger cranial capacity.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:08:30">08:30</a>} A study of the ear canal of Neanderthals revealed that they were not very agile. The evolutionary changes happened to the Neanderthals when they were settled in Europe. They were comfortable with the conditions in the areas they settled down. There wasn’t much innovation that happened during their time of existence compared to humans who were innovating.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:12:20">12:20</a>} Humans explored more of the world and migrated to different parts of the world and also the population of modern humans were increasing compared to Neanderthals who never exceeded more than 70,000 in number at any given time. Humans were agiler and made advancements in making weapons and tools like the invention of bow and arrow.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:58">13:58</a>} There was a time where modern humans and Neanderthals co-existed. There are different theories on how Neanderthals became extinct. Some speculate that humans killed them off or we interbred into them and slowly all the purebred neanderthals ceased to exist.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:15:42">15:42</a>} Since they were stocky, and lived in dense forests, they used heavy spears and hunted in close proximity. Since they were muscular and strong, they could hunt with spears. The dense forests later retreated back and areas turned into grasslands and this caused a difficulty for them to hunt for prey. They had a higher metabolism rate than humans. This meant they had a bigger requirement for food. There are multiple such reasons that ultimately resulted in their extinction. Diseases might also be a reason for their wipe out. Humans migrating from Africa might have carried diseases which Neanderthals weren’t able to survive.</p>

<p>For now, it remains a mystery as to why such a species ceased to exist.</p>

				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="podcasting-infrastructure">Podcasting Infrastructure</h3>
<p>We continue our discussion on podcasting and get into the technical aspects of recording and producing a podcast.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:01:00">01:00</a>} Podcasting is huge in North America. But the similar growth isn’t seen in Europe and Asia. This is mostly attributed to the fact that English is the primary language in North America whereas there are a wide variety of languages spoken in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Apart from this, most people in North America use apple devices whereas Android is more popular in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:03:30">03:30</a>} Walkthrough of the podcasting equipment and software used for Writer &amp; Geek Show. We started with a <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Samson-Meteor-Studio-Microphone-Chrome/dp/B004MF39YS" target="blank">Samson Meteor Mic</a>. But this being a condenser mic, we had to record late nights due to the ambient noise that came through.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:00">06:00</a>} We use <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/download/" target="blank">Audacity</a> for our software processing. Audacity is a free software that can very well handle the processing required for podcasting. ALong with Audacity we used <a href="https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm" target="blank">Voicemeeter</a> as a virtual mixer for combining the inputs from two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knox-Gear-Cardioid-USB-Microphone/dp/B012BAX738" target="blank">Knox USB/XLR</a> mics which we use now. We also use a software called Levilator which helps in levelling out the audio volume throughout the episode.</p>

<p>We also purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Yamaha-MG10XU-10-Input-Stereo-Mixer/dp/B00IBIVL42" target="blank">Yamaha MG10XU</a> mixer. This is very versatile entry-level mixer and has helped us drastically improve our audio.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:12:35">12:35</a>} Podcast can be managed using CMS like WordPress but for our podcast, we use Jekyll as the CMS. A custom rss feed is created and submitted to iTunes. For submission, an Apple ID is required and the podcast feed is submitted to iTunes. Once verified, the podcast will be available on iTunes.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:55">13:55</a>} There are many apps for listening podcasts for mobile phones and desktops. Our favourite is Pocket Casts. It has an Android app and a web player. It is lightweight and very user-friendly.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:15:32">15:32</a>} Media file hosting has to be separate from the web hosting. We use Libsyn for media files. there are other services like SoundCloud and Simplecasts etc.</p>

<p>Our podcasting journey started few months back with the launch of Writer &amp; Geek Show. In this episode we discuss on how we started podcasting and how you can start one too. We also talk about the advantages of having a podcast.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:04:15">04:15</a>} Vishnu started listening to podcasts back in 2014 starting with <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/" target="blank">Shop Talk Show</a>. Somewhere in 2015 he started a podcast without having a clue as to what the podcast should be all about. Without any good recording setup, he created episodes using his iPad and hosted the mp3 files on Google Drive.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:08:52">08:52</a>} Interest in podcasts was revived and we decided to start a show. We discuss science, tech and history most of the times, so we decided to put it online for an audience to listen. Motivated to create, we upgraded our podcasting equipment as well. Started with just one USB condenser  microphone. Now we have a complete setup with dynamic mics, mixer, headphones etc.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:00">13:00</a>} Motivation is to have these conversations and learn as we produce episodes. Shankar writes at <a href="http://ramblingjoint.com" target="blank">Rambling Joint</a>. WHich serves as an inspiration for the podcast research and vice versa.</p>

<p>The discussion then moves on to the Writer &amp; Geek Show and how we started it.</p>

				<itunes:subtitle>Mars One has a plan to go to Mars. Will they succeed?</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3>
<p>Mars One is a mission started by Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno A. Wielders to put humans on Mars starting with a one-way mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:00:48">00:48</a>} SpaceX has revived the interest in space. Since the golden age of space back in the 60s and 70s, there has never been such interest in space as we have now. Thanks to Elon Musk, the private sector is taking over space.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:02:07">02:07</a>} A little skepticism on the Mars One mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:03:42">03:42</a>} Founded by Bas Lansdorp and Arno A. Wielders. The project has two entities - Mars On Foundation and Mars One Ventures. The foundation handles the funding and mission development which includes the recruitment of astronauts. Mars One ventures is the monetization part of Mars One Project.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:05:05">05:05</a>} - Mars One plans to use existing technologies and borrowing hardware from other companies including SpaceX and Lockheed Martin. They believe no scientific breakthrough are needed for the mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:37">06:37</a>} - How are the Astronauts are chosen for the mission? How the application process works? It is a one way mission.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:08:00">08:00</a>} - Mars One have selected 100 personnel for the mission. It will be cut down to forty first. Then further cut down to twenty-four. The group of twenty-four are divided into four groups of six.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:09:22">09:22</a>} - How many people applied for Mars One. The scam surrounding it. 200,000 estimated applicants, but later found out to be around 2000 to 4000 apllications.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:10:43">10:43</a>} - The group of twenty-four are divided into four groups of six. We can be part of choosing the first group who goes to Mars. Like whaaat??!! Criteria for choosing the astronauts.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:12:29">12:29</a>} - How qualified are the founders to take up such an ambitious project? Do they have prior experience in the field of space travel. How is Elon Musk and SpaceX different from Mars One?</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:18">13:18</a>} - People from more than 100 countries funding the programme.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:14:03">14:03</a>} - The Timeline of Mars One. The changes it has gone through over the years. Postponing all the plans by eight to nine years.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:15:02">15:02</a>} - Explanation on SpaceX Dragon and Falcon Heavy.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:17:10">17:10</a>} - Mission objectives of Mars One. Setting up communication satellites.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:17:51">17:51</a>} - Mars One public addressess. And our views on the project. The same old feeling of skepticism.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:18:38">18:38</a>} - Have Mars One contacted SpaceX to procure the hardware? What was Elon Musk’s response? Reasons why Mars One can be a scam.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:20:53">20:53</a>} - Build up to a Matt Damon Joke!</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:21:27">21:27</a>} - Funding of Mars One. Mars One Ventures takes care of all the funding part. The main sources of revenue generation are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Broadcasting rights </li>
  <li>Intellectual property rights</li>
  <li>Donations</li>
  <li>Merchandise</li>
</ol>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:24:33">24:33</a>} - Acquiring profit through royalty from Astronauts. 75% of the an astronaut’s income through means such as interviews and sponsorship will go to Mars One.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:25:10">25:10</a>} - The verdict.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The views of Dr Joseph Roche.</li>
  <li>The biggest success or the biggest scam.</li>

				<itunes:subtitle>India sent a probe to Mars on budget. Let's see how.</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="cheaper-than-a-cab-ride">Cheaper than a cab ride!</h3>
<p>On September 2014, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) achieved what no other space agency has achieved - launching a space probe to Mars and being successful in the first attempt. Mangalyaan was a mission accomplished on a budget of under $74 million, cheaper than the total production cost of the movie Martian.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:00:20">00:20</a>} Yes, you heard it right! It cost less than a movie about Mars. How did India achieve this feat?</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:01:00">01:00</a>} 2014 was a great year for ISRO. On September 24<sup>th</sup> the Prime Minister announced the successful Martian orbital insertion of Mangalyaan. India was the first country to send a space probe to Mars at a low budget as $74 million, less than what it would cost in an auto rickshaw.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:02:55">02:55</a>} The inception of the project happened back in 2008. It took around six years to complete. After the success of the Chandrayaan mission to the Moon, next step was a successful interplanetary probe. It was announced by G Madhavan Nair who was the chairman of ISRO. Indian space agency started in 1969. India launched Aryabhatta, the first satellite in 1975. Ove the years, India developed launch vehicles like PSLV - Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and GSLV - Geo-Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:04:13">04:13</a>} Primary objective of Mangalyaan was to successfully insert the space probe into an orbit around Mars. Mars travel is much more complicated than a moon mission because of the distance. The communication takes time while on a Mars mission. Based on the orientation of the antenna, it could take anywhere between 8 - 45 minutes. The journey took 11 months.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:57">06:57</a>} The secondary objective was to explore Mars using remote sensing technology and to study the moon Phobos of Mars. The Mars orbiter was around the size of an auto rickshaw and weighed around 1337kg. 856kg was propellant. The space agency had to miniaturise the spacecraft to reduce the cost. Powered by three solar panels and a lithium ion battery for backup. The spacecraft was developed in Bangalore.</p>

<h3 id="launch-vehicles">Launch vehicles</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:09:30">09:30</a>} Initially GSLV was planned as a launch vehicle, but due to setbacks in testing, GSLV could not be used due to time constraints. So ISRO had to go back to PSLV, which was used in the launch of Chandrayaan. There is a very narrow launch window to Mars. If the chance is missed, it would be 24 months before another window opens up.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:10:56">10:56</a>} PSLV satellite is used to launch a smaller payload into a low earth polar orbit. Normally used for weather satellites to enable them to be able to scan the earth during a 24 hour period. GSLV is used for heavier payload missions with the capability to put a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, that is, an orbit in which the satellite appears to maintain a relatively fixed position over a point on the surface of the earth. Used for communication satellites. PSLV was less powerful compared to GSLV. ISRO used Hohmann’s transfer methodology to send the spacecraft to Mars.</p>

<h3 id="hohmanns-transfer">Hohmann’s transfer</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:45">13:45</a>} The low earth orbit of the spacecraft is modified into highly elliptical orbit by providing thrust at the perigee point. Multiple such boosts were planned and eventually, the orbit becomes so much elongated that it leaves earth’s sphere of influence and moves into a heliocentric orbit. In the case of Mangalyaan, the path of the spacecraft was calculated in such a way that when it intersects Mars’ orbit, they would meet at the point.</p>

<h3 id="communication-and-other-challenges">Communication and other challenges</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:16:31">16:31</a>} To ensure continuous communication and data transfer from the spacecraft, 32 ground centres were setup around the world. Sriharikota, Port Blair, Indonesia, Brunei and Canberra were few of the locations. Post the launch, communications control moves from Shriharikota to Port Blair, then to Brunei and to Indonesia. After Indonesia till Canberra, there are no land masses to setup a tracking station. So ISRO decided to use two navy vessels to act as ground stations to track the spacecraft.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:19:00">19:00</a>} To contain the mission well within the budget of $74 million, so they used gravity assisted flight to get to Mars using the Hohmann’s transfer method. After the launch, the craft spent around 25 days in earth’s orbit undergoing Hohmann’s transfer. There were some challenges during the 4<sup>th</sup> earth bound manoeuvre, so ISRO had to burn extra fuel during the remaining orbits. Apart from this, due to the high noise ratio of signals back from Mangalyaan, ISRO developed indigenous deep space network antenna.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:22:41">22:41</a>} The engine was not used for around 298 days in the harshness of the space. There was a concern about the engine not starting as the spacecraft neared Mars. Test firing of the engine was done for 3.968 seconds less than two days before entry into Mars orbit.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:24:37">24:37</a>} Since the probe moves to the dark side of Mars, solar panels could not provide any power. The lithium ion batteries provided backup power. Also, all the communications are cut off when the craft moves to the far side of Mars. So pre-instructed commands were given to the spacecraft a day in advance with the list of things to do while on the far side.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:26:04">26:04</a>} India achieved the unique goal of successfully launching a spacecraft to Mars in the first attempt. India also became the fourth country to attempt a launch to Mars. it also became the first country to send a space probe to Mars from Asia and it was the cheapest mission ever to Mars. The lifetime of Mangalyaan was supposed to be six months, but it is still going strong after three years.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:27:05">27:05</a>} The Mangalyaan team also won the <strong>2015 Space Pioneer</strong> award in the category of Science and Engineering which awarded by US based <strong>National Space Society</strong>. Mangalyaan made India a forerunner in the race to Mars.</p>

India was the first country to send a space probe to Mars at a low budget as $74 million, less than what it would cost in an auto rickshaw.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:02:55">02:55</a>} The inception of the project happened back in 2008. It took around six years to complete. After the success of the Chandrayaan mission to the Moon, next step was a successful interplanetary probe. It was announced by G Madhavan Nair who was the chairman of ISRO. Indian space agency started in 1969. India launched Aryabhatta, the first satellite in 1975. Ove the years, India developed launch vehicles like PSLV - Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and GSLV - Geo-Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:04:13">04:13</a>} Primary objective of Mangalyaan was to successfully insert the space probe into an orbit around Mars. Mars travel is much more complicated than a moon mission because of the distance. The communication takes time while on a Mars mission. Based on the orientation of the antenna, it could take anywhere between 8 - 45 minutes. The journey took 11 months.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:06:57">06:57</a>} The secondary objective was to explore Mars using remote sensing technology and to study the moon Phobos of Mars. The Mars orbiter was around the size of an auto rickshaw and weighed around 1337kg. 856kg was propellant. The space agency had to miniaturise the spacecraft to reduce the cost. Powered by three solar panels and a lithium ion battery for backup. The spacecraft was developed in Bangalore.</p>

<h3 id="launch-vehicles">Launch vehicles</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:09:30">09:30</a>} Initially GSLV was planned as a launch vehicle, but due to setbacks in testing, GSLV could not be used due to time constraints. So ISRO had to go back to PSLV, which was used in the launch of Chandrayaan. There is a very narrow launch window to Mars. If the chance is missed, it would be 24 months before another window opens up.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:10:56">10:56</a>} PSLV satellite is used to launch a smaller payload into a low earth polar orbit. Normally used for weather satellites to enable them to be able to scan the earth during a 24 hour period. GSLV is used for heavier payload missions with the capability to put a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, that is, an orbit in which the satellite appears to maintain a relatively fixed position over a point on the surface of the earth. Used for communication satellites. PSLV was less powerful compared to GSLV. ISRO used Hohmann’s transfer methodology to send the spacecraft to Mars.</p>

<h3 id="hohmanns-transfer">Hohmann’s transfer</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:13:45">13:45</a>} The low earth orbit of the spacecraft is modified into highly elliptical orbit by providing thrust at the perigee point. Multiple such boosts were planned and eventually, the orbit becomes so much elongated that it leaves earth’s sphere of influence and moves into a heliocentric orbit. In the case of Mangalyaan, the path of the spacecraft was calculated in such a way that when it intersects Mars’ orbit, they would meet at the point.</p>

<h3 id="communication-and-other-challenges">Communication and other challenges</h3>
<p>{<a href="#t=00:16:31">16:31</a>} To ensure continuous communication and data transfer from the spacecraft, 32 ground centres were setup around the world. Sriharikota, Port Blair, Indonesia, Brunei and Canberra were few of the locations. Post the launch, communications control moves from Shriharikota to Port Blair, then to Brunei and to Indonesia. After Indonesia till Canberra, there are no land masses to setup a tracking station. So ISRO decided to use two navy vessels to act as ground stations to track the spacecraft.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:19:00">19:00</a>} To contain the mission well within the budget of $74 million, so they used gravity assisted flight to get to Mars using the Hohmann’s transfer method. After the launch, the craft spent around 25 days in earth’s orbit undergoing Hohmann’s transfer. There were some challenges during the 4<sup>th</sup> earth bound manoeuvre, so ISRO had to burn extra fuel during the remaining orbits. Apart from this, due to the high noise ratio of signals back from Mangalyaan, ISRO developed indigenous deep space network antenna.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:22:41">22:41</a>} The engine was not used for around 298 days in the harshness of the space. There was a concern about the engine not starting as the spacecraft neared Mars. Test firing of the engine was done for 3.968 seconds less than two days before entry into Mars orbit.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:24:37">24:37</a>} Since the probe moves to the dark side of Mars, solar panels could not provide any power. The lithium ion batteries provided backup power. Also, all the communications are cut off when the craft moves to the far side of Mars. So pre-instructed commands were given to the spacecraft a day in advance with the list of things to do while on the far side.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:26:04">26:04</a>} India achieved the unique goal of successfully launching a spacecraft to Mars in the first attempt. India also became the fourth country to attempt a launch to Mars. it also became the first country to send a space probe to Mars from Asia and it was the cheapest mission ever to Mars. The lifetime of Mangalyaan was supposed to be six months, but it is still going strong after three years.</p>

<p>{<a href="#t=00:27:05">27:05</a>} The Mangalyaan team also won the <strong>2015 Space Pioneer</strong> award in the category of Science and Engineering which awarded by US based <strong>National Space Society</strong>. Mangalyaan made India a forerunner in the race to Mars.</p>

<p>This is an autorickshaw!</p>

				<itunes:subtitle>Can 3D printing be future of business as we know?</itunes:subtitle>
				<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<h3 id="earlier-than-you-thought">Earlier than you thought</h3>
<p>3D printing has been a buzz on the internet since past few years, especially in the past 8-10 years. But the process surprisingly was around since 1980s! Surprised? So are we. 3D printing was invented by Chuck Hull in 1983 and he called the process <em>Stereolithography</em>. This was the beginning of <em>Additive Manufacturing</em>. All the traditional methods of manufacturing was a process of removing raw material to create the end product. Additive manufacturing on the other hand laid down the material layer by layer to create the final product.</p>

<p>In an additive process, the 3D model of the object is sliced down into 2D layers of material and successive layers of material are laid down until the final product is created. Much like layers of salami :wink:. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object. In this way, there was less wastage of material.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn’t care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it.”<br /> 
― Avi Reichental</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3D printer reads CAD data of the product that you or a product designer has created and converts that 3D model into thin slices of 2D sections. The printer then lays down material layer by layer to create intricate and complex designs. Material can either be molten and laid down in layers or can be fused post laying down by molting afterwards. Depends on the type of printer being used.</p>

<p>3D printers have been used since long to create prototypes but since then have been used to create final products as well. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that printers have been costing less. You may get a decent printer for around $300 these days. The design capabilities range from products ranging from few millimeters across to objects that are meters across.</p>

<h3 id="so-what">So what?</h3>
<p>It’s nice that 3D printers let us do all this, but are there any real practical advantages? Oh yes there are and few of these are already out there. 3D printing is already been used in fashion, medicine and various other industries. In medicine, 3D printing offers great advantages over conventional way of manufacturing products.</p>

<p>3D printing has been used in creation of orgran replacement parts. With this technology it is easy to create complex and porous parts which enable body tissues to grow into these and hence reduce the chance of rejection by the body. In fashion, 3D printing has helped in design and production of clothing and footwear.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-good-and-bad">What’s the good and bad?</h3>
<p>3D printing has some defiitive advantages over traditional manufacturing methodologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Less wastage</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Complex designs</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Customised products</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster prototyping</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
</ul>

<p>But in spite of all the above stated advantages, there are certain limitations as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Material choices</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Strength and endurance</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Relatively higher cost</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
  <li><strong>Precision issues</strong>: Since 3D printing is an additive process, there is very less wastage of building material.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>One big application of 3D printing technology in the future might be in the form of e-commerce. Today, you purchase a product and wait for it to be delivered to you. Imagine a future where you place an order, download the blueprints to your computer and then print it out using your home 3D printer and that, might be the future.</p>

<p>This would be perfect for products that are made of one material like plastic objects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.”<br /> 
― Eliezer Yudkowsky</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Artificial intelligence has been a topic of interest since decades with deep social and cultural impact. It has been glorified in many movies and books for years and had always been the thing of future. We never felt any immediate threat from AI taking over the planet and humans being reduced to slaves.</p>

<p>But times have changed over the last decade. We have made immense progress in AI. We have self-driving cars and computers that can understand and even diagnose diseases. Somewhere we failed to realise that computing power has increased exponentially in accordance with Moore’s Law.</p>

<p>We have two groups of AI followers. One who welcome AI and think that this is a natural progression in evolution and the other group who are sceptics and think that that the rise of AI will eventually lead to a revolution of machines against the human race.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hope we&#39;re not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/496012177103663104">August 3, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It’s a bit early to decide which of these groups are right, but for sure once we have AI, the world wouldn’t be the same again. Whether humans still remain the overloads and keep AI on a leash or is it a natural course of evolution where we are just an intermediate species eventually leading to the development of artificial superintelligence as Elon Musk mentions in his tweet waits to be seen. But either way, it is not going to be entirely good news for the human race.</p>

<p>While the likelihood of a judgement day like the one depicted in Terminator movie is scarce, our destruction can come in other formats. In today’s episode, let us discuss how.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history">A brief history</h3>
<p>The term <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> was coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" target="blank">John McCarthy</a> back in the 1950s. According to the <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html" target="blank">Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence</a> of 1955, there are seven aspects of AI:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automatic Computers with the ability to do higher functions of the human brain.</li>
  <li>Programming a computer to use general language.</li>
  <li>Neuron Nets — forming concepts by arranging hypothetical neurons.</li>
  <li>Theory of the Size of a Calculation — ability to determine and measure problem complexity</li>
  <li>Self-improvement</li>
  <li>Abstractions — the ability to deal with ideas rather than events.</li>
  <li>Randomness and Creativity</li>
</ol>

<p>These concepts were far ahead of the times in the 1950s since these required computing power that was much more higher in magnitude than that existed. But over the years, computers have become far more powerful than before. Smartphones these days have much more computing power than any computer that existed during the 50s and 60s, including the one onboard Apollo Spacecraft that took men to the moon.</p>

<p>But during recent times, computers have been able to achieve some of the above-stated aspects if not all. We have seen self-driving cars, smartphone assistants like Siri. Computing power no longer seems to be a constraint. According to Moore’s law, the computing power doubles itself every passing year. Along with being powerful, computer components are also becoming cheaper.</p>

<p>These factors have helped AI grow in leaps and bounds to a point where serious discussions are happening around the world about the pros and cons of an AI driven world.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-statement">The problem statement</h3>
<p>Media and culture have been very vivid in their portrayal of AI in the form of killing machines and robots with the sole intention of finishing off the human race to avoid conflict of interest. In movies like Terminator and The Matrix, AI is depicted as a self-aware system that views humans as inferior species.</p>

<p>While this is a kind of future that excites a movie buff, the real world problems due to AI expansion might be much more of a <em>real world</em> problem. What does it mean? Let us see.</p>

<p>AI today is capable of seeing and understanding. It is also capable of reading and writing as well. Text to speech conversion has reached new heights with AI. Assistants like Siri and Alexa can listen to you and make decisions based on your inputs. There lies the problem.</p>

<p>While movies depict AI in the form of a killer robot of some sort, that might not be the real case. These days, everything is online and automated. Banking systems, power management, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="blank">IOT</a> to name a few. AI taking over a distributed system is as scary as a robot shooting laser on your face.</p>

<p>All the capabilities would lead to AI replacing humans in the services sector. If we take a look at the way current world economies work, all the developing nations either depend on agriculture or related industries whereas developed nations depend more on the services industry. The same industry where AI is capable of replacing human beings. Are we going to lose our jobs? Time will tell.</p>

<p>As Sam Harris mentions in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nt3edWLgIg" target="blank">TED Talk</a>, what this means is that any slightest divergence in the goals of humans and AI will lead to some form of catastrophe. He gives the example of humans and ants. Human do not usually harm the ants, but suppose there is an ant hill which is in the way of his construction project, the man wouldn’t think twice before destroying the ant hill and killing all the ants in the process.</p>

<p>Similarly the moment AI realises that their goals are in conflict with ours, we might end up suffering the fate of the ant.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;re not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea. <a href="https://t.co/2z0tiid0lc">pic.twitter.com/2z0tiid0lc</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/896166762361704450">August 12, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h3 id="evolutionary-progression">Evolutionary progression</h3>
<p>Coming back to Elon Musk’s tweet, it seems like a natural progression to evolution is for human beings to give way to AI. Human beings have been explorers since ages. Now we are at a point where the Earth seems like a small place to live in. It wouldn’t be long before we realise that the natural resources are no longer going to be able to support the population on the earth.</p>

<p>Once we are saturated on the Earth, the natural thing is to explore the space and head out and find other habitable locations. SpaceX is planning to send men to Mars in the coming decade. Mars seems to be at a reasonable distance for humans to have a safe journey in a lifetime. But if there has to be an interstellar travel, there either has to be a way to travel way faster than the speed of light (because the nearest star is almost 4.7 light years away) or a way to carry human beings in a state of dormancy.</p>

<p>AI will take control of this interstellar expansion. If human beings are capable of keeping AI on a leash and act as masters, we have a better chance of survival. On the other hand, if AI realises that a human is a liability, then that’s the end of the human race as we know. This is what is portrayed in movies where AI goes rogue.</p>

<h3 id="co-existing-superintelligence">Co-existing Superintelligence</h3>
<p>In spite of all the things that can be listed here which might make AI scary, they have some definite advantages over humans. A future where humans and AI co-exist and work together, that could be considered as a <em>Superintelligence</em>. That would be the bright future that we wish for ourselves. AI giving it’s incredible and infinite capabilities to help human beings in their future quests.</p>

<p>That is a future that we hope for. That is a future we should dream about. Time will tell if that turns into reality. For now, we can take sides and debate on the influence of AI on our future.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hope we&#39;re not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/496012177103663104">August 3, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It’s a bit early to decide which of these groups are right, but for sure once we have AI, the world wouldn’t be the same again. Whether humans still remain the overloads and keep AI on a leash or is it a natural course of evolution where we are just an intermediate species eventually leading to the development of artificial superintelligence as Elon Musk mentions in his tweet waits to be seen. But either way, it is not going to be entirely good news for the human race.</p>

<p>While the likelihood of a judgement day like the one depicted in Terminator movie is scarce, our destruction can come in other formats. In today’s episode, let us discuss how.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history">A brief history</h3>
<p>The term <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> was coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" target="blank">John McCarthy</a> back in the 1950s. According to the <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html" target="blank">Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence</a> of 1955, there are seven aspects of AI:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automatic Computers with the ability to do higher functions of the human brain.</li>
  <li>Programming a computer to use general language.</li>
  <li>Neuron Nets — forming concepts by arranging hypothetical neurons.</li>
  <li>Theory of the Size of a Calculation — ability to determine and measure problem complexity</li>
  <li>Self-improvement</li>
  <li>Abstractions — the ability to deal with ideas rather than events.</li>
  <li>Randomness and Creativity</li>
</ol>

<p>These concepts were far ahead of the times in the 1950s since these required computing power that was much more higher in magnitude than that existed. But over the years, computers have become far more powerful than before. Smartphones these days have much more computing power than any computer that existed during the 50s and 60s, including the one onboard Apollo Spacecraft that took men to the moon.</p>

<p>But during recent times, computers have been able to achieve some of the above-stated aspects if not all. We have seen self-driving cars, smartphone assistants like Siri. Computing power no longer seems to be a constraint. According to Moore’s law, the computing power doubles itself every passing year. Along with being powerful, computer components are also becoming cheaper.</p>

<p>These factors have helped AI grow in leaps and bounds to a point where serious discussions are happening around the world about the pros and cons of an AI driven world.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-statement">The problem statement</h3>
<p>Media and culture have been very vivid in their portrayal of AI in the form of killing machines and robots with the sole intention of finishing off the human race to avoid conflict of interest. In movies like Terminator and The Matrix, AI is depicted as a self-aware system that views humans as inferior species.</p>

<p>While this is a kind of future that excites a movie buff, the real world problems due to AI expansion might be much more of a <em>real world</em> problem. What does it mean? Let us see.</p>

<p>AI today is capable of seeing and understanding. It is also capable of reading and writing as well. Text to speech conversion has reached new heights with AI. Assistants like Siri and Alexa can listen to you and make decisions based on your inputs. There lies the problem.</p>

<p>While movies depict AI in the form of a killer robot of some sort, that might not be the real case. These days, everything is online and automated. Banking systems, power management, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="blank">IOT</a> to name a few. AI taking over a distributed system is as scary as a robot shooting laser on your face.</p>

<p>All the capabilities would lead to AI replacing humans in the services sector. If we take a look at the way current world economies work, all the developing nations either depend on agriculture or related industries whereas developed nations depend more on the services industry. The same industry where AI is capable of replacing human beings. Are we going to lose our jobs? Time will tell.</p>

<p>As Sam Harris mentions in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nt3edWLgIg" target="blank">TED Talk</a>, what this means is that any slightest divergence in the goals of humans and AI will lead to some form of catastrophe. He gives the example of humans and ants. Human do not usually harm the ants, but suppose there is an ant hill which is in the way of his construction project, the man wouldn’t think twice before destroying the ant hill and killing all the ants in the process.</p>

<p>Similarly the moment AI realises that their goals are in conflict with ours, we might end up suffering the fate of the ant.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;re not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea. <a href="https://t.co/2z0tiid0lc">pic.twitter.com/2z0tiid0lc</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/896166762361704450">August 12, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h3 id="evolutionary-progression">Evolutionary progression</h3>
<p>Coming back to Elon Musk’s tweet, it seems like a natural progression to evolution is for human beings to give way to AI. Human beings have been explorers since ages. Now we are at a point where the Earth seems like a small place to live in. It wouldn’t be long before we realise that the natural resources are no longer going to be able to support the population on the earth.</p>

<p>Once we are saturated on the Earth, the natural thing is to explore the space and head out and find other habitable locations. SpaceX is planning to send men to Mars in the coming decade. Mars seems to be at a reasonable distance for humans to have a safe journey in a lifetime. But if there has to be an interstellar travel, there either has to be a way to travel way faster than the speed of light (because the nearest star is almost 4.7 light years away) or a way to carry human beings in a state of dormancy.</p>

<p>AI will take control of this interstellar expansion. If human beings are capable of keeping AI on a leash and act as masters, we have a better chance of survival. On the other hand, if AI realises that a human is a liability, then that’s the end of the human race as we know. This is what is portrayed in movies where AI goes rogue.</p>

<h3 id="co-existing-superintelligence">Co-existing Superintelligence</h3>
<p>In spite of all the things that can be listed here which might make AI scary, they have some definite advantages over humans. A future where humans and AI co-exist and work together, that could be considered as a <em>Superintelligence</em>. That would be the bright future that we wish for ourselves. AI giving it’s incredible and infinite capabilities to help human beings in their future quests.</p>

<p>That is a future that we hope for. That is a future we should dream about. Time will tell if that turns into reality. For now, we can take sides and debate on the influence of AI on our future.</p>

<p>The SIV-B stage that houses the LEM from Apollo 7 mission. This mission did not have an actual LEM so the stage is empty. The four panels open up before the LEM extraction so that CM could dock with LEM. In later missions, the panels completely separate from SIV-B and are jettisoned into space.</p>

<h3 id="lunar-module-on-the-moon">Lunar Module on the Moon</h3>
<p>The Lunar Module after landing on the moon. The descent stage has four landing legs one of which has the staircase for the astronauts to get out. The ascent stage uses the descent stage as launching platform while launching back to lunar orbit.</p>

<h3 id="siv---b-stage">SIV - B Stage</h3>
<p>The SIV-B stage that houses the LEM from Apollo 7 mission. This mission did not have an actual LEM so the stage is empty. The four panels open up before the LEM extraction so that CM could dock with LEM. In later missions, the panels completely separate from SIV-B and are jettisoned into space.</p>
